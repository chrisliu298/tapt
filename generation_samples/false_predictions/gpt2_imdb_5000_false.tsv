Wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I love Ron Livingston as Tom Deveraux, I think he is so great. But after the first few minutes of this film, I was hoping for a sex scene that would lead to some real comedy. It was the opposite. The whole point of this movie was to be funny and some kind of a classic snoozer about boredom and uptightness. Some how, I fell asleep. When I woke up, I was so frustrated by the incompetence of the film. It's not that I didn't like the actors, they were great, but the screenplay was completely unconvincing. For example, Tom being kind of a jackass, and then being mean towards Tom's sister who he thinks is ugly. The scene of the funeral seems awkward and not at all what the writer intended, but these two characters of Tom and the sister just make this movie all the more annoying. There is just nothing here to recommend. This is one of the worst movies ever made. 	1	0
So, every year there is at least one movie, that makes absolutely no sense. This is one of them. It's a story about 40-something people that were bored and want to have fun. The beginning is pretty simple. They're all drinking in a pub, about to go to a rave. Suddenly they meet a strange couple that doesn't know what they're doing and invites them to their house. Of course, you've heard the stories about that couple and we, the viewers know it won't be the good kind, this is the bad kind. The plot is boring and doesn't make any sense. There are really no jokes, just some crap thrown into the mix. But, the good thing is that none of them make sense. One of them even has the U-shaped triangle logo on the sign. Yay for simplicity! <br /><br />The other types of story are actually just empty jokes. There's a murder mystery in this movie, but, there's no killer. Two guys are in an argument about their love, when a girl shows up. But, she should have been killed. Another one is about some schizophrenic guy that has nothing in his life that he wants to do but he just somehow gets there. It's really boring and predictable. They even send a minister t	1	0
"I want to clarify a few things. I am not one for zombie movies, but I also think that there are some good ones out there, some that are good but not as good as others. I even thought ""The Bodyguard"" was great, it is a quite unusual movie. I enjoyed it very much. I feel like if you ask me the movie would be done differently with some good actors and director to make it different than the usual movie. But I also have a dark opinion on gore. I am not one of those people that likes big, booby-trapped houses, but in zombie movies they always seem to add a little something special (such as making the victims soghast, but some gore fans seem to forget that actually most zombies don't feel the need to feast upon blood, it is for the producers).<br /><br />With the other opinions I have come up with to comment on this movie, I felt that it wasn't good, but for the reasons that have been mentioned, I don't think that's possible. The movie was not what I expected to see, it was poor, but not terrible either. It has a beginning and a middle and it takes two hours or so to complete. The acting is not bad at all and I think that director Yousse"	0	1
"I wasn't sure at first if I was watching a Disney adaptation or a TV series, but with the opening lines of the song ""Dreams Come True"" I couldn't see what the difference was. This story was right up my alley, from the pop-up restaurant scene to the two narration films (they're the same movie). The reviews I read were mostly positive and constructive. So I decided to check it out. My expectations were quite high, but I was a little disappointed.<br /><br />The movie is about a family who move to a remote town where other families have moved, unfortunately for them the town is becoming an abandoned mine site where massive amounts of earth are being taken to make way for tunnels and machines to mine. While they live there, they are on their honeymoon and on a research trip. During one of their adventures, they are attracted to a sad looking man who gives them a ride home. When the townfolk find out about it, the girls go to confront their elders and they are arrested. Now the family is threatened and have to fight to keep their innocence and get out of this awful place they've lived.<br /><br />As a parent I am often frustrated by Disney movies. While I may enjoy a good adventure movie as long as it's cute, friendly an"	1	0
About a year ago I finally gave up on American Pie altogether and fell on the serious side of the coin. The show was terrible and the writers were down to earth. I recently found out that the show was cancelled and that's when I decided to take a look at some of the other sitcoms out there. I quickly picked up one and I'm glad I did because Love Actually is one of the better ones. The pilot episode I watched was also quite good. I can see why it flopped, the characters were not very well developed and the story was hardly original.<br /><br />Plot: Our characters Jack and Kate (played by Joey Buttafuoco and Katey Sagal) are friends who meet over coffee one day and decide to break up. The only problem with their meeting is that they have an unpleasant childhood. Jack wants to take a vacation to a vacation spot in Mexico with his college boyfriend Kelly (played by Joey Essex and Loretta Young). The whole thing is stupid and lame. He and Kelly get together and they go out to a park and have a party and then they get together and Kelly shows him some awful drawings of animals and it starts to go downhill from there. Kelly doesn't get her reasons for being angry and he ends up sleeping with her. All is not well wit	1	0
I am watching this movie right now on WTN because it reminds me of the best when I was a kid. The story is simple - a female fell in love with a big bull-dozer. She won't tell him her name, but he will. In time he will find out where she lives and how to find her. But first, he must rid himself of another bull-dozer and save his young girl from harm. After that, he will get a great reward.<br /><br />The beautiful Mabel Stapleton was the only bull-dozer in the movie, although all of the others were nice. So I guess she didn't act all that well, but he would have deserved it anyway. Sarah Michelle Gellar also looked good in a lacy blonde wig. I would have given it more stars, but she was only in this for a short time. There are a lot of nice pictures in the movie.<br /><br />7 out of 10 stars. <br /><br />*** out of 5 stars. 	0	1
"Before this, the flawed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was the best. But they deserve far better. It's not just the era, it's the acting that is wrong. He KNEW he was making a fool of himself. This film is just another shot in the arm. "	1	0
In what I can say was a theft of my leftovers from last week's fun house...heated airyness, hungry reveries of infamy, giggling sappy brats, and bad movies go together like chocolate milk and wax. The Stig has sent his body to Andromeda in search of new and delicious carnal desires and the store they find him are chicks who kill each other and bodies that have been burnt into the bones of their enemies. He, of course, must recapture the body of his first victim, the tall and gawky radiated sexy golden haired hunk with an annoying accent and who's daughter (clearly deranged and sluts) is the best thing about every scene she's in. From there it's a struggle to not wake her up as the man that has been corrupted from the inside out. Wham. Wimpy Wimpy Wimpy Wimpy Wimpy....all that music. One of my favorite soft porn movies ever. 	0	1
Of life in (some) colleges. Of course there were artistic figures whose dreams were going to be realized. But all of them - Lumière, Raoul Dufy, Stravinsky and Beethoven - had their limits. Can I tell you the one I dreamt of? I dreamed of joining the Hassoarden opera house: after the movie (check it out!), I tried to visit it every day. The noise from the opera were even worse than the in-between concerts. Besides, the young people were not very good in getting used to the crowds. Plus, as a student, my parents took me in to fight the crowds. Of course the atmosphere was very difficult, and the young people could hardly speak French: after the movie, they spent a lot of time improving themselves.<br /><br />Watched this on TV some time ago, and I was amazed at the acting and the movies that were actually shot. However, I still wouldn't recommend to anyone. I hope that someday it will be shown on France 1, and probably the next time on TINY EUROPA. 	1	0
Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be junk. This one, 'Quartier des Exclaves,' follows a couple of friends on their way to see a concert in the French Quarter. They stop at a house with a view, and find out that the former proprietor has gone under, and so they move on. They soon learn that if one lives there a week, one can't go home until the next day. No one will be home when their date finishes. The men make their way to a bar and find a place for the evening; they get everyone to pose for pictures and hide out for the night. During this time, they make love, and the men talk about dreams and memories; then the clock strikes midnight and the couple and the rats decide they're out. In the morning, some of the remaining men find a partner, a blind woman, and start a fight with the rats; the deaths aren't reported until the next day when the police arrive. Much of the rest of the movie is in the strip-mall-chic bar where the men make their way down the roads and visit lots of fine old places; their only stop is the hotel where the murderous cat is staying. The deaths are all mysterious and predictable and the movie has only a slight plo	1	0
this movie was rather awful Vipul Shah's last movie was called Goodbye Baby which you can see that it is his last movie. The movie starts with some girl who is raped and there are more rapes and you will see some blood and some smoking. later on the same day there is a fire in another house which turns into a forest but only by heart. then there is a robot zombie which turns into a girl because it is made by wife/scientist of head of head, and then finally the killers show up. The movie is very short and just what I had hoped for when it was first released, sexy girl killing zombie movie. But in my opinion this movie will cost you at least 2 to 3 hours of your life and what more could you ask for when you are watching a 3 minute indie flick in a place like this. except maybe the ending which is really so lame. 	1	0
As of this writing John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is nearing it's 29th Anniversary and is one of the most popular horror films of all time. Having said that the film is absolutely unique in it's structure of a guy who finally gets his powers back and becomes a normal, though scary and increasingly mad, suburban guy whose evil plans to destroy all life on earth (though very technically done and convoluted) simply didn't work out and he's left alone to enjoy the rest of his life(or would they if there was a little more screen time for the bad guys).<br /><br />There's some very inventive early sequences (such as the use of gags within the movie in the form of a car chases with cheesy puns on top of car chases and a climatic and tense showdown involving an old man and a friend where each of them literally stand on a cliff of a cliff over a suspension bridge) that keep you wondering just when all hell is about to break loose, there's the supernatural element where you can't help but sense that the bad guys (and by extension, the hero in this case) are out to get us all but then you remember that in real life, they really were out to get each of us so it's less of a scary horror movie than a slow and tediously predictable trai	1	0
"This movie, supposedly a thriller, had about five sub-plots that really sucked...But I still think it was a great movie. The lead actor played a decent character, and very good in his job. The support cast was pretty good. It had a cool idea, a good plot, and a good thriller at its core. I love Jason Bourne and I'm excited for his movies.<br /><br />Here's the deal...First of all, I'm a big, big fan of James Woods. I don't say that just for the voice. I also consider him one of the best actors to grace the screen over the last ten years. This movie plays like he's trying to do a Q&A interview.<br /><br />Second, there are a lot of ""cool-sounding"" sub-plots. Like...<br /><br />After a pre-teenaged wife gets into a pretty serious fight with a rival cousin, her boyfriend on the other side of the planet goes missing. The first thing that pops into your head when you think ""Why is that guy missing?"" is to think of James Woods and ANOTHER bloody-minded crime-scene scene, not to mention that kid's surfing video game console. And then the same kid finds out about the missing guy by looking into th"	0	1
The fight scenes were great. Loved the old and newer Nick Lyon fighting styles. The story was really good. The music was good and fit the movie very well. Still the fight scenes were too short. This movie could have been much better. If it was a while ago you would have been entertained. Then again you are probably already bored with this series. If you like Rhymesayers than you should give this one a try. See for yourself. 	0	1
"Kids - of whatever age - do not want to see zombies get blown up. We get it, but we get it in spades, too. This show stars an amoral, destructive demon-boy (Jon Cryer) who's spent the last year (2005-2007) as part of an experimental brain-washing experiment at a chemical company. Intrigued by Cryer's evolution as a zombie, the company begins secretly brainwashing its workers and making them, in return for their obedience, go on a killing rampage. It's all part of a vicious game played out by the husband-wife team of Guy Matheson and Lucy Liu (Ian McShane and Michelle Forbes) to show us just how evil our society really is.<br /><br />""Dirty Dancing"" can be seen as a kind of primer to see how ""Zombi 2"" plays out, what new blood we're getting for our show and perhaps get the viewers to actually ""get it"" when it happens. The only problem is that we get it here, but we need a little more explaining from the brain-washing creep. So what exactly does the brain-washing involve? A full month of intense psychological torture followed by a Zombie-like transformation. The discovery that Cryer is now a zombie-boy a"	1	0
CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag. Part vignettes of class antagonism and class conflict, part funny and brutal good-vs-evil exploits, part sometimes sad and gritty as the titular title character, it's just not one of its time. It's a lot more diverse and interesting to listen to than its Japanese-language predecessor. And while the stories themselves aren't particularly imaginative or touching, they're presented that way in order to make them more palatable to an American audience. Basically, despite some of the strong acting, the major issues are ones of class relations. Unlike its predecessor, however, CITY HALL isn't overlong, there's little exposition or suggestion of what's going on, and it doesn't offer much more than the tired stories first presented to us, the tone seems downright grim, and the film's dialog seems a bit overdone. The plot of the original was a complete mystery, but after seeing this short, it becomes clear that most of the new stories are more mystery than intrigue. It's also clear that this is a sad, though never truly dark, film that never seems to give the viewer any chance to relax or even enjoy it. Even if the lack of serious drama makes it somewhat difficult to appreciate the film for what it is, there are some elements of humor in this shor	1	0
Reviewing KAZAAM and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard. Considering there are some really good ones (SOLO, JAPANESE DANCING, THE SEA HALL), I'd say that KAZAAM is just average. No one is the star of this film, and besides the infamous Madeleine Stowe (with some no-talent assistance), nobody else really stands out. Why do I say this? Well, for one thing, I was in high school and attended that year's show. I like to think that this is a worthy film even though it's much, much better than any of the low-budget work out there nowadays. No, it's not a really great movie overall, but it doesn't quite rise above average. There is, however, something very good about the story, which involves a smart guy (David Boreanaz) getting lost in some mountains. So he leaves his guitar, stupid (and sometimes partially out of the context of the movie). Along the way, he finds out that the place where he's been is the place where KAZAAM (an animated house in Japan) lives, and he has to find a way to get back into the town and see what's going on. The movie runs through almost the entire film at a decent pac	0	1
"If you want mindless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic setting...you'll love this one. If you want an eye-opener into a society that's already destroyed, you'll be disappointed. The numbers are nice, with some amazing special effects. The only thing that kept me from having fun was that one piece of dialogue - one that goes, ""Let's just leave civilization behind."" But when you stop to think about it, is this even the point? It is a waste of time watching this. "	1	0
"I found ""The Arab Conspiracy"" in a bargain bin and lost track of how many times I watched it. It's not the best movie ever, but it's one that is well worth a watch. (And it's not just me.)<br /><br />For anyone who has the misfortune to hear Air Force One fly into Baghdad, they are soon informed that the missile launcher they're carrying has been sabotaged. The Navy hijacks an oil tanker and several hours later, they blast it into the North Sea.

I have no idea. There is a lot of talk about terrorism, but few people seem to consider the very strong possibility that this movie is about something else--about a conspiracy.<br /><br />A nuclear bomb? Never mind.<br /><br />Why are the American Arabs in control of the government? Can't they just use their power for good? Well, yes, they can, but if the rest of the world wants to recognize that we're in fact human beings, then let's rise up and let them have their governmen"	0	1
Everyone we meet influences our thinking, modifies our ways, a popular cliché from yesteryear. But if you think about it, it may actually be better to do so rather than to decide to simply present the stories of those we meet in our personal lives. In a way, this book is a condensed version of Monty Python's Life of Brian: a society full of actual individuals.<br /><br />Who are the people we meet? Who are the characters? How and when do they change and grow? And if we are to make any sense of the person we meet we must actually see them, interact with them. What are they and where do they live? Not only that, we have to make sense of ourselves and even form opinions about ourselves and others based on our own experience.<br /><br />In the end the philosophy of this movie is not a terrible one, if you are interested in the topic that can only be found in philosophical books. What is interesting, however, is not that philosophy is an art form, but that in the modern world it is very much a matter of personal opinion. We have become so obsessed with rationalizations of 'ordinary' reality that the individual must put himself or herself forward to have our respect. To have the moral conviction that everyone else has to push on their belief	1	0
"I have read several good reviews that have defended and praised Alice Walker's book. I am no fan of her. I would love to go back to her book if I had the chance. It is one of her best books. She is great in the way that she shoots and breathes emotion and emotion makes you want to cry in an instant. But if you want to tear up you could just think about your child. All she has to do is put the book in the bathroom before she wakes up. The book was a big part of my soul. I remember my grandmother asking me to read the book and my answer was ""Yes, just one page"". What would you do with a good book? We read Alice Walker because we love her so much and because we want to. Not because she told us to. "	0	1
Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well.<br /><br />The concept of an evil god is very cleverly used in the film. Each time the evil god appears, the audience is exposed to his evil ways. That is, the action usually involves an army of orcs (played by Mike and Jim Krueger), a giant spider (Peter Sellers), or the likes of whom we have never seen before. These big and scary creatures are, of course, going to kill the main character and the rest of the characters in the film.<br /><br />This is accomplished by creating an atmosphere of dread. That is, fear that comes from the presence of a real and evil demon.<br /><br />Now, after watching the film, the ending seemed incredibly abrupt, and I can't explain why, but it just kind of shut the entire film down. There was not much else to do but to continue watching the film until the evil God himself appears. By the end of the film, I didn't want to leave the theater. (I could have stayed and watched the film, but I'd rather watch something else.) 	1	0

Updated version of a story that had been turned into a sitcom when these two young men were sent to prison in the early 80's.<br /><br />Andrews and Holmes are late 20's Americans who had just broken into the home of a woman, who had recently died. The ensuing struggle starts when Holmes, whose sister had already died, finds out about the contents of the closets and ends up killing the woman's boyfriend. Holmes is sent to a mental hospital, where his patient morale is at a low and the staff is kind of nervous. He visits a psychiatrist who suggests that Andrew, whom he knows from talking to other patients, was responsible for the suicide.<br /><br />In the beginning this film looks like it was written by someone who was thinking, and acting like someone who was already in a film - Jeff Conaway has a hard time managing the blobby hair, Viggo Mortensen does the usual haggard look and Alice Krige looks like she could go crazy with a sheaf of tissues. In the second half of the film, with the involvement of John Holmes, the mental problems seem to calm down. Conaway and Mortensen and Krige now look like semi-functioning normal people.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be 	1	0
"Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit YANKEE DRIVE is a veritable treat for Corman fans. Their enjoyment of this film is almost innate, and its three somewhat ridiculous ""free-falls""--the horse-whipped for a turn as the slow-witted brother of its owner, the boozy town singer bribed by his deranged estranged brother to sing at his teenage daughter's party to impress the rich girl on his friend's bimbo fiancé--are the mark of a good Demme film. But the real gem of YANKEE DRIVE, unfortunately, is not that one little car crash. Although normally referred to as a movie that is ""topped off"", YANKEE DRIVE actually contains several instances of excellent, and thoroughly improbable film-making, that have me scratching my head at how this film, without a great deal of money or talent, could ever have come about. First off, YANKEE DRIVE does not even feature the mildly entertaining M.C. Gainey, the hilarious wisecracking ""The Amazon Princess"" who had me captivated for several weeks during my high school years, because her part is completely unnecessary and poorly placed--and that about sums it up.

To be honest, I didn't like that much this movie. Sure it had some good parts, but I didn't think that it was worth the price of admission. Another thing I didn't like was the character that played Shana: She was pretty good, and I thought she was an interesting actress. Of course I was wrong. She was horrible, and my thoughts were mixed.<br /><br />Well, I did find myself getting sucked into the movie, and a few times during the movie I was left feeling really really bad. The movie could have been better, there were some things that I wished they could have changed. If I would have watched this movie two hours ago, I would have never felt so unsatisfied with my movie experience.<br /><br />3/10 <br /><br />I would definitely recommend that people watch this movie, just to be entertained. 	1	0
"This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. It reminded me of the old campy movies I once saw on ""50 First Dates"" - The movie was cute, the actors were likable, and the plot was interesting. But the movie was so over-the-top and contrived that it turned me off from watching it. What a shame. At first I figured it had to be the animation. It was designed so that people would look like they were the same age they were acting in the movie. But the film's problems really begin with the overly contrived plot: the precocious janitor gets married and then lives in the big house while two older kids are living in a big house. What?! What kind of grandmother would give their daughters such a huge, ""cool"" house in a big, ""cool"" suburb. How far can you go with a two story house? How long can you keep up this ridiculous, ridiculous storyline? If this was your only movie, I wouldn't bother. But the potential is there. The story doesn't need to be so contrived and over-the-top to be appealing to kids (or adults). I especially liked the moment when the older kid goes outside to play - and the younger boy is sitting there playing hide-and-seek. That wa"	1	0
Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood worst overrated films.<br /><br />The concept of Bollywood overrated is common today, but it is all thanks to the mistakes of director Manoj Bajpai. Arjun looks more like a school boy and sports less body than a mafia boss.<br /><br />Arjun did a great job as the villain - man meets boy and boy meets girl. He shows depth of acting and i believe that he is the best villain in Hindi cinema. It is great to see the amount of talent in the movies of Mamta Kapoor and Akshay Kumar - though they over do their roles.<br /><br />But the most important thing is that Mamta Kapoor gave an outstanding performance as Arjun's 'Yeh Mata Rasool' and Akshay Kumar plays a completely natural lead character. Even the part where Arjun asks them to stop drinking may have been a mistake.<br /><br />Amarindra Bachchan plays the 'Honey Badger' and is wonderful.

Any story comprises a premise, characters and conflict. Characters plotting their betrayal and betrayals. That is not the case in this version. His Majesty the King is not in Rome to start the new century. It is not about the Queen and her family at all. The story has him at the end and not too far away, being monarch of the kingdom. This version makes it difficult for him to sit back and enjoy the life of an aristocrat and go from being a simple, well funded banker to kingsman. The history is not told. The initial conflict of the Elizabethan Era with the courtiers, princes and MPs that formed the upper class that John Pitt speaks of is never shown. The first two hundred years are skipped over as there are no compelling reasons for such a massive and overreaching	1	0
I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime (depending on my area) and it was so cheap and yet so good. Their was such a lot of swearing, but they were trying to be funny. As for the plot. A famous guy (Dax Shepard) makes a bet with his neighbors (Jonas Brothers, Jennifer Long and The Today Show Co-Host Katie Couric) that he will kill the daylights out of some one. Sheens up, and goes ahead and bets her life to do it. But a group of guys and a dumb girl decide to give it a go.<br /><br />If you don't watch HBO or Showtime and you're a just a regular guy or gal out there who loves pretentious movies (Me, me, me), check out this.

When I saw this movie I was stunned by what I heard about it. I can't believe that this little piece of video went straight to DVD. A hard lesson to learn from the failure of the recently released version of Jaws. A movie that was a lot better than I could have imagined. Another lesson is: learn from every failure in your life. Because they've taught me one...don't watch this movie. You might as well start with your life and the good news is that once you get out of it, you will be far better off. Oh, did I mention that you can ruin your life by watching this movie? One can always decide what they want to do in their life. And they chose to ruin their lives by watching this movie. 	1	0
"In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis did a TV movie titled Big Deal. In it the drug trade was involved. The story involved actors, musicians, and people involved in the trade. That's it. And by the way, they were pretty good at that. No marketing, no fluff. Well that's the movie we're talking about. But what really started this remake was another movie about the drug trade. It was named The Dirty Dozen. It was a made for television movie starring Martin Landau. But the story and the acting was of a reality show hosted by Jon Bon Jovi.<br /><br />That's right. Bon Jovi's host. You may be thinking, what's Bon Jovi doing playing the host of this reality show? I have no idea what he's doing. He's playing himself, but this is so you don't have to. The movie takes place in Miami. They've had two homicides in the city. One a murder of a reporter and another a murder of a stripper. The fact that the stripper was found with a gunshot wound to the head is absolutely incredible. When she ran from the scene, she actually said to her driver, ""You gotta call the cops on me"".

Not good! Rent or buy the original! Watch this only if you've already seen the cut. This is not a sure thing, even though the crew are back. Tony wasn't human, so you can't really blame him for these mistakes. At least the one that killed Meg was not a grizzled vet like him! There are things that really can't be fixed.

The fact that at least my children can't comprehend any difference between ""I love you"" and ""I love you again"" just begs the question as to why there are so many movies such as this that are available to them! I give this movie high marks in that it doesn't hold a lot of actual value, other than maybe one day in the not too distant future they might show it to my children or grandchildren for them to understand and not to just take it as gospel on its face that it's just bad acting. If the 3 kids stay inside for a while, I would definitely recommend that they stay and watch the movie. "	1	0
"Just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time and I had to point out the sometimes strange little things I noticed during the movie. The points made are not meant to be taken as evidence of how good the movie is, but are just a few points that are found to annoy me during and after the movie.<br /><br />Some important points that annoyed me were the murder for credit and the fact that Camilla wasn't even killed in the ""red alert"". This proves that the police were pretty much out of their minds for the first 40 minutes after the shooting. There is NO evidence that either Samira or his accomplice tried to escape from the police at the time. In fact the policemen didn't even wait for him to drop off the vehicle!<br /><br />The point of the movie was the murder for credit. I understand that a murder for credit can still be quite disturbing and dangerous in a movie theater. For example, The Haunting (aka Wendigo), which I have seen on TV and on the DVD, was just that, a murder for credit. It was there for the entertainment value and wasn't particularly scary. However, the fact that the murder was for credit is like putting a dead baby in a refrigerator for movie theatre purposes. It doesn't mean tha"	1	0
"""Back of Beyond"" takes place at a dive diner/gas station and revolves around two local safari guides (the director of ""Tupac Shakur: In the Company of Men"" and the writer of the script for ""On the Waterfront"", Andrew Neuland) who bring Peralta along on their wild safari trip in Mexico. While in Mexico Peralta meets Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, who teaches Peralta that when he takes a life he loses it forever. The two follow Che to the small town of Antigua where he learns that there is a long awaited nuclear bomb located deep within the San Juan Mountain Range.<br /><br />Guevara also teaches Peralta about freedom. Che tells Peralta that a man called Fidel Castro made a deal with the government which guaranteed the freedom of all Cubans after the end of the revolution. Che also tells Peralta that a famous explorer named Walter Brennan (played in good old Che's voice by Jeffery Combs) knew that the government would not allow any money to be spent on ""refugees"" so he chose to escape Cuba to Venezuela in order to avoid a political assassination attempt by Castro. Following this Peralta is captured and put on trial by Castro for what he knows about the bom"	0	1
"THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is the third in a string of poorly directed (and only three in a string) independent films that border on the disgusting. In this movie, a gang of teenage boys (yes, seven of them) decide to spend a night of fun ""rolling"" in a rundown house they rent from a truck driver (even though the guy himself looks like he rented it himself). After there are two early deaths and four more fights, the crew are released, and after realizing that none of the house's inhabitants are really that nice, they all get drunk and hide out in a nearby house.<br /><br />What I love about THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD is the fact that it explores some extremely disturbing themes. First and foremost, the movie is a portrait of incest. The main character, an eleven year-old boy, (I kid you not), has a homosexual attraction to his older brother. When a gang of unknown boys decides to murder a kid and then celebrate by cannibalizing the head of the murdered boy, the oldest of the boys (at least in this film) comes up with the idea of hiding his semen in the bodies of his victims, so that it will eventually turn into ""blOOD."" In order to get away from his hateful friend, the oldest boy hides hi"	1	0
"Jake Speed (1986) was an amusing parody of Indiana Jones and Buster Keaton. It was also an interesting idea to make a film about Billy the Kid. It was directed by Mr. Don Wilson and it was known as ""Spaceman 3"". The idea to make the film was to have Buster Keaton stand and be Superman's sidekick and to have Jake Speed play Jake Speed in the film. We still do not know how Jake Speed became an Army Private. He and his Colonel Hank Sandeson are the only two characters in the film that do not have a singing voice or anything like that. The spoof was created by writers William Castle and Gary Burghoff and appeared in the movie's first two minutes. What bothered me most about this film was that they tried to make a ""serious"" parody of a kind of F. Scott Fitzgerald. They tried to make a comedy/drama with a happy ending. They tried to make a ""serious"" comedy/drama with a happy ending. What they succeeded in was a funny thing with a bad ending.<br /><br />The film starts with Jake Speed (Buster Keaton) sitting down to write a story about how a girl turned out to be a gymnast. Jake Speed's father is a miner who turns Jake into a wrestler so that Jake ca"	1	0
"On the basis of the preview I'd seen, I went and rented this movie. I was told it was ""so bad, it's good"" but I had not forgotten the old joke. So I was completely surprised by the movie. If it had been the more serious directorial treatment, the premise would have been interesting, but this movie was almost puerile and obvious from beginning to end. There was little surprise to the plot - the opposite of the cold, objective, callous indifference of Baz Luhrmann's film. The result is that I was underwhelmed even after 20 minutes of the tedious American journalist trying to understand his own wife's obsession (after she married a Japanese and an American, has she forgiven him?) or simply having her hate another woman. <br /><br />As a sociological study, this movie is sort of like the ""psychology"" of American men and women, more or less than ""craziness"" with whom we hold. On the one hand, men are so permissive of each other, that only a little effort is needed to talk them into sex. On the other hand, women see everything with men's eyes and men in their minds. American film (mostly talkies, not used for great effect) obviously refers to the mind of both men and wome"	1	0
"Another Spanish movie about the 1936 Civil War. This time it focuses on young Republican Unionists in Chicago. They are trying to pass a Freedom of Association Act to allow unionized workers to take part in the summer labor strikes. They all hold the views of the ""idealistic"" students. Throughout the movie they play a variety of roles. Two of them are farmers and union sympathizers. They get together at the end to agree on a permanent solution. They do not, as some posters would have you believe, support the good cause. It is all a great disappointment to watch one of the less-interesting characters who seems ""just out of school"" come together with people who are just as ""out of school"".<br /><br />More details about this film are in a historical diary posted by the author.

""" It had to be You"" is another sign that God Almighty needs to take a good look at this industry. It is not enough just to tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth, there has to be the stories of people who love and respect one another, and people who can show the miracles of Jesus through their own actions. When you ask the question ""Who are these actors?"" or ""Who are these directors?"" you only hear the answers of the thousands of people, and when there is none of the answer, you are left with the feeling that the world really is unfair to these people. I dare you to watch this movie and not feel that pain.<br /><br />A man is sold by his niece for 100 dollars and when he returns home he is deeply in love with her but when he goes to do the deed they are never friends.

However, Jesus doesn't have these problem and at the end he is even better off.

"The first thing I thought after watching ""Mystery Men"" was that Roger Ebert was one of the worst critics I have ever met. Not because of his lack of knowledge about the film or for any other reason, but because he doesn't give a damn about the fact that this film is an important cinematic entity that deserves to be respected for what it is, and there are only two flaws that his review represents: (1) he gave this film so much bad review and (2) he wasted his precious time. The first problem I have with Ebert's review is that he mentions some rather obvious flaws. Firstly, this film had some potential, but it completely faltered after 2/3 of the way through. So basically the movie could have been done much better if the supporting cast, plot or dialog would have been more clearly explained and carried the necessary tension. When a movie is an intelligent piece of writing and it comes close to running out of steam early on, its best to not worry about the outcome of the film, and let the plot take over. Take a second to ask yourself: who would have thought that ""The Fantastic Mr Fox"" could attract the greatest cast of comic actors, acting talent and musical talent in Hollywood's history in the same way that it did? Also the role of Robert Mitchum was playe"	1	0

"As other reviewers have noted, this is an unjustly neglected movie.<br /><br />It's the story of a 14-year old woman who can't seem to get her hands on her father, who's near death in a plane crash. As the years go by, his son, Lonnie (Mickey Rourke), tries to figure out what happened in the crash.<br /><br />She gets the idea that perhaps the plane was shot down by the ""old men"", on behalf of the ""old men"" in the company of ""old men"". This scenario makes no sense to the heroine, who couldn't care less about being ""alone"". She wants to have her own man, and she wants Lonnie to help her get there.<br /><br />A widowed widow (Gina Garces) meets Lonnie (Rourke) in her home, where she's seeing her children. While waiting for Lonnie to arrive, she develops a crush on him. And while she struggles to make a relationship work, she also gets heavily into an affair with a friend of hers. <br /><br />So where does all of this leave the sympathetic son, Dan (Willem Dafoe)? Of course, there's a hidden agenda going on: his father isn't dead"	1	0
"I sat through both parts of Che last night, back when my cable bill was like 3 times as much as it is now. So here I am, after 20 minutes of monotonous torture, and being forced to watch this movie again, just to see the end credits roll. The first thirty minutes were painful. I saw something called ""Love/Hate"", and thought maybe it was some sort of crapy American horror horror flick, but it was never really clear, and some horror movie buffs like to think that any good movie is at least interesting, and somewhat interesting...but this was just a mindless parlor trick and not really any kind of credible masterpiece or shocker. This is a great example of how cheesy many horror movies can be. As someone else said, the ""plot"" wasn't that good, and the scenes felt a bit rushed. And, don't get me started on the ending, which was kind of predictable, but yeah, it wasn't too much of a surprise...and seeing that I was already too mentally scarred to watch the whole thing, I had to leave at the end. The ending was probably just too upsetting. They should have brought up a friend at the end and told him to say something. The acting was also extremely questionable. Adrian Pasdar was okay, but hi"	1	0
Kurosawa really blew it on this one. Every genius is killed here and every single thing is taken out of context. In the first film Kurosawa made a love triangle for the entire world in one way or another. In this film we are presented with a one-dimensional guy with a one dimensional smile who slowly sees the passion and happiness in each of his girlfriend's eyes as soon as they meet. This guy's interest in making love to every girl in the world is, of course, turned away by the fact that his person is an object of curiosity. The joke is if this guy was only a timid girl who needed some attention he would take it well because by now you will have read the other comment I made.<br /><br />To put this film in perspective, the Japanese studios produced two more classic films: Futo Festival of Fantasy (1939) and Futo Festival of Love (1940). Even though these films are definitely inferior to Kurosawa's, they are just under two films and we are getting so old that you can laugh and take it with a grain of salt. This was an interesting concept in itself but everyone involved in this film was clearly behind a commercial pitch. There are no gadgets, no surprises, no surprises, this isn't funny comedy.

Hearing such praise about this play, I decided to watch it.<br /><br />The movie is fun. It's not perfect but I'd say it's decent. The acting is excellent. The direction is interesting. It's full of humor. The set design is impressive. The story moves along nicely.<br /><br />It has a certain charm that will appeal to film buffs. If you don't like or love animated movies it will also appeal to non-animators.<br /><br />The movie is just a little bit watchable. Not as funny as The Great Mouse Detective.<br /><br />If you're not feeling bored just stay away. It's a good experience for someone else but not for yourself. 	0	1
"*!!- SPOILERS - !!*<br /><br />Before I begin this, let me assure all that I am not a fan of pick-up-artist films or the acting of any kind of human being. I've always been an admirer of Tom Cruise and I didn't want the rest of his cast to be pigeonholed into one of these categories; all he can do is maintain an enjoyable charisma that gives him an edge over his cast members and somehow a magic number of actors that can be pretty easily pigeonholed into the one or two ""classics"" that are ""all guys"" like himself. The problem I faced with this film was that it was too similar to Vincent Price's cult film ""Pleasure to Die Hard"". By taking so much of its fundamental premise and run with it, everything basically flowed into a good but inconsequential tale. However, I think the audience that I eventually gave it to should have seen this film with more of an appreciation for its darker side and a greater understanding of how this brutal death in a cockroach infested building was affecting the various characters in the film. By using the three main characters as the central plot devices for the film, the remaining characters of the film were easily pigeonholed into the latter two groups and the story fell flat when presented in the latter rather than the forme"	1	0
Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the small town of Raynes where he is hired by a lawyer by the name of Alex Krycek (Tim Blake Nelson) to represent his client Jeffry Spencer (Reid) as he is set to plead guilty to killing his two sons (Sean Young and Paul Young). Jeffry Spencer decides to remain in jail with Tom Drake in order to raise his sons and their brother Cale, and later Kayden Dixon (Jodie Sweetin) and Emory Hamilton (Jenna Jameson) who are both in Evanston Illinois with Jeffry Spencer. Alex Krycek brings Jeffry Spencer to a new place of business (calling himself Ice Cold Cole) where he meets actor Tobe Hopper (Dustin Hoffman) and his friend Arnie Singer (George Burns) who is Jameson and Hamilton's best friend and it seems they have found their man for Kayden Dixon (Jenna Jameson) to murder her boyfriend Paul Young.

"Rather than move linearly from beginning to end, this story takes itself seriously and its lack of resources -- it was shot on a 16mm documentary look (the final cut looks like a 70s commercial for the movie, which is quite decent). The acting is good, the plot quite interesting, the flashback footage fascinating and good, but there are two scenes in particular that got me rolling.<br /><br />First, the role of Felix. Felix is a pure case of a very isolated pedophile whose parents are both dead and he's had the habit of having off days in order to abuse his victims. Felix's constant visits to the library and having his paintings hauled away from him at 6 a.m. by his babysitter seem to fuel his urges to sexually exploit his victims, to them pain even. The same could be said for Anne, who finally gets to be exposed to a grown man, which makes the scene even more disturbing.<br /><br />Second, the part of William. William is Felix's best friend and is quite easily the most sympathetic of the three. He's not exactly the same as Fred, who is rather sympathetic but totally too distant and childlike to be any kind of sadistic sadistic sadist (it's quite clear in ""Fred and Ginger"" that William does not enjoy bein"	0	1

I came into this movie really wanting to line it. And guess what? I did. The movie is full of plot holes, scenes which are mostly cut and even stupid special effects which are meant to be funny. But it also got really slow and had a very low budget and was very well paced. Well it just so happens that all of these very bad acting skills are channeled into this movie and it shows. The story really hasn't much to do with the original, and there isn't anything much to do with the first one. The movie also has a theme that couldn't have been better, maybe it would have worked if it was better known by movie producers and directed by some other people, but it isn't. All in all a fairly slow paced movie, but a very enjoyable one nonetheless. 	0	1
"I was raised in a ""very Christian"" household since birth. So naturally I thought that by the time I was four I would be really familiar with the Bible. And I certainly would be familiar with its views and contents. <br /><br />My family was a very conservative Christian family. I suppose it must have been a tough upbringing for them to ""see the light."" With lots of emphasis on discipline. Also on some very controversial topics. One of the issues that was a big topic during my preschool years was at what point a child's sexual orientation could be considered sinful. Did you know that when a teenager says ""I'm gay,"" and then later continues ""I'm straight,"" that is a sin? <br /><br />Since we didn't believe that this kind of ""sin"" existed, and it was an important topic for the family to discuss, the discussion was to begin at a young age. There were really only two other discussion sessions that year; and then, after that, only one session per day, but that was my only way of being able to talk to my parents about this subject. <br /><br />Every Sunday, my parents would attend services, and our Sunday School teacher would accompany us.

Allen and Julie move into a cabin in the mountains and settle down in the four-room house. There is a small fire pit inside, but it is very sparse. It seems to have been the home of many people in the past, but not for a very long time. They are astonished to discover that they are actually living in a cave, with very thick walls and ceilings. However, there is much more. It looks like a horror movie, but that is a little misleading.<br /><br />The beginning of the film is quite scary, and Allen and Julie begin to think that the ominous sounds coming from their dark house are coming from outside their cabin. When they begin to see the dark walls and ceilings of their house and hear strange noises coming from the cabin, the doubts begin to mount. It is at this point that the movie begins to move to its second and final phase, as we get to see in person some of the strangest things we have ever seen and heard. From this point on, the movie drags and it is obvious that the director was not very deep into the house. But, because of the performances and creative story told in the movie, the director seems to do what he must to put out the fire that is about to engulf them.<br /><br />My Ratin	1	0
"Frequently voted China's greatest film ever by Chinese critics, as well as best produced in the country, this play (by Li Shufang and his wife in fact)was and is based on the true story of a highly regarded writer and dramatist, who, in response to the poor state of China's literary scene, declared ""no play like the Chinese novel"". This novel consists of six stories (under six lines) that deal with the interaction of the Chinese people in a state of anarchy, feudalism, and consumerism, and the various choices that the author makes to cope with these difficult circumstances. Initially the stories were presented in six-lines, but slowly they began to take on a more and more brutal structure.<br /><br />Well-produced and well-cast, there are moments in the first three stories that bring tears to my eyes, not the least of which is the story about an order of monks who become utterly insufferably ridiculous and vulgar. There is also a story about a bullied girl in a train station (brilliant), a story about a public health worker who takes in a homeless man (very realistic), and even a complete black comedy about the nepotism in China (of course a light comedy, not part of a heavy comedy).

"Was'nt really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But like Raw did so many times on Wednesdays, it was not in any particular way entertaining. It was boring, it had a weak plot, and it left the audience wanting more. John Cena's ""uselessness"" as a wrestler was nowhere near as well explained as other rumors had it. His momentum was useless.<br /><br />Also, the reason why Cena's personality was so weird in the 1st PPV was largely because of the business move. He was good at using the grunts of ring girls in the ring, which was fine with Mr. McMahon, but not good enough for Raw. He could not be a great ladder match breaker even though he used to be in WWE's top tag team, which kept WWE running. It was not to say he was better than they were, but he was better than the majority of the roster.<br /><br />Raw had some opportunities to build a decent plot, but they missed out on a lot of opportunities to do it well, and they made a lot of mistakes that should have been avoided.<br /><br />I give this 3 out of 10.

"I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully scary thriller that could have been on the cover of the video store. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't. For the most part, it was pretty obvious from the beginning of the movie that the film was designed to have a goofy feel and take place in the woods. This isn't a bad thing, because really the plot is pretty stupid and very illogical. Instead, it's this element that makes a good horror movie like NIGHTMARE at the Oasis so good. If you have a decent sense of humor, and are a sucker for scary movies, this isn't one of them.<br /><br />Zabriskie Point has basically two movies in it.

Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's recent outings. While the idea of the giant fish might not have been for everyone (I'll come out and say that the creatures in this film are actually quite cute and give the film a unique look, the story really needed to be more cohesive and realistic), for a Disney Disney audience it does at least provide some entertainment value.<br /><br />Another issue I had with this film was the story's lack of a clear explanation about who Ariel is, and what she is able to do to find the right piece of jewelry for herself. She is obsessed with finding an diamond and using it to become even stronger and powerful. This might be a good idea in the premise of the film as it gives the viewer some idea of the way Ariel behaves during that time, but in the actual plot, this isn't seen, making the story extremely confusing. While this is most definitely not a bad thing in terms of what Disney's latest (and best) animated feature lacks, I was kind of disappointed that the story wasn't clear about who or what Ariel really is. The film would also have been better served if the concept of the diamond being a key piece of her ultimate ability could be shown more.

"I'll be quick to address the matters of the film's notoriety and tag it with the word ""stupid"" as I am sure many of you can name at least one other movie on which you have heard the exact same words as this one: ""it is an insult to my intelligence"".. It might even be a joke if you're going to call it that. These reviewers make no attempt to hide their contempt for the Japanese animation community (and I'm not even a US citizen myself).. which I am sure has a lot to do with it. ""Diablo III"" for me is a jarring example of how stupid we all are and no matter how hard we try to forget the 'goonies' moniker we keep conjuring up all these years later, this is a cheap slap at all the people who did the creative writing, voice acting, production, marketing, and marketing for the film and I'm quite certain you could not field six players on your own at a tournament and have each one memorize the same lines in less than an hour if that was your goal.

Ya. That is what I think. Sure it was still bad...but who ever had the mischievous ideas to make a film like this, should be setting that sorry record straight now. No one is saying that this was the worst film I've ever seen, or for that matter, the funniest film I've ever seen. That's only the kind of unfair opinion you hear about how bad this film was. The fact that no one else has ever thought to see a similar film shows that somebody had a really good idea, and that's good enough. I highly recommend seeing this film, or the cheesy Super Mario Brothers rip-off, because you might actually enjoy this film. And the only way I could consider wasting my money on such a crap film is if I actually have a decent toilet.<br /><br />I heard some of the actor's family and friends are in this film, so if you're really fan of bad, pointless cinema, see this one. 	1	0
In 1914, Charlie Chaplin began making pictures. These were made with cardboard or cloth. He had to invest in special effects to make his films effective, but he had to rely on the actors, which was a problem in those days. Mr. Chaplin was the only one who made good use of cardboard in his films. A poor photograph can't replace a great actor's voice or screenplay. Here is one of Chaplin's best pictures--Jaws. In this picture, a great disaster surrounds the Titanic. The moment the doors of the lifeboat open, a great burst of flame shoots out. This is portrayed as an explosion in the movie, but that does nothing for the picture. This is a much better picture than Titanic. Some may disagree with me. Let me say that, to make things worse, the fire is not even directed toward the ship. It's a blast. I saw this on television--he really shows it and its just horrible.<br /><br />A modern film with stock footage might have been a better film--but that's another story.

Ruth Gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that we've seen in a long time. She's just as cold-blooded as usual, but this time she kills for the wrong reasons. She's following the advice of her husband who's running a local florist business. There, Ruth finds herself falling for a customer named Bobby Colvin, who seems more interested in ruining her husband's career than meeting any women. Despite having a terrible history with Colvin, the two fall for each other and he soon starts seeing his dead wife. Her husband and his greedy family figure out what's going on when they receive a tip that Colvin has been cheating on Ruth with his former employee, and he's soon arrested.<br /><br />Like most horror films, this is a rape mystery film. The men that are here seem like the typical suspects. There is no real point in seeing the various serial killer types that could have killed, because once you start focusing on any of them, the movie becomes tedious. The only reason I gave this a 3 instead of a 1 is that the characters really don't do anything to warrant a tryout with one of the prison break types. I think it's almost appropriate that instead of going after the men who have an association with Colvin, it's Colvin who goe	1	0
This is an interesting little flick made in 1967, with many futuristic touches and is more of a 1960s crime movie than a modern sci-fi flick. It's mostly from the perspective of two characters, Bea (Reginald Gardiner) and Janes (George Derek). They are hustlers who live in a trailer park on the outskirts of town. Janes works at a photography shop and Bea has a job at the local taxi stand. She is also a bit of an antihero. It's not hard to find that in this movie, and she's somewhat good at it. The funniest scene is when Bea is helping Janes steal some shoes from a hardware store, and they get into an argument about how Janes couldn't afford them. Just a very silly scene.<br /><br />The plot involves a shopgirl (Maya Lane) and her husband (Richard Mack) who want to live in a trailer park. Bea and Janes move in. Janes sells almost nothing, but just keeps Bea and Janes company. Bea is also forced to help her husband out at the paint shop (although he doesn't work there very much). One day, Bea learns that her husband is about to be evicted from their trailer. She calls Janes and bring	1	0
"This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should possess--sex. It is not just the extreme sexual content. The plot revolves around ""The Wild One"", a major scientific research facility that is created for the supposed purpose of producing the perfect weapon. A big switch that was never made turns out to be the will of one female student at the facility that wants to destroy humanity with her magic powers. Her actions are so wicked that the professor is forced to put in a transvestite voodoo priest to keep her from going down. In this film, the villain is obviously played by the chief of staff of the facility and he also has to do some atrocious acting in this film. I can't stand his ineptitude as he tries to attract all women with the sole goal of destroying mankind.<br /><br />The acting was not bad by any means, but the most pleasurable part of this film was when I saw Ben Coccio's performance as the mad professor. He is truly one of the most well made men I have ever seen and in this film, he was great. He had a job to do to complete his assignment as the mad professor. What he was doing was great and had to keep it a secret to keep him from being captured by his superiors. He also fell in love wit"	1	0
"I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just recently bought Voyager for $9.99 and was really excited to see the first episode come to DVD. I can honestly say I'm not disappointed. I'm so glad I gave it a try. I can't say it was the best or worst episode but it sure is good for the many kids and adults who grew up watching this show in the 90's and early 00's. Let's face it, people will say, ""Well...okay, TNG is better"" and that's true. I will admit that DS9 is the better of the two shows (even though it's still not quite up there with TNG). I can't say that people shouldn't watch DS9 but if you don't have kids, and don't watch it on a regular basis, don't. There are other shows to watch. "	0	1
"I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - after all, I had only seen the original ""Scary Movie"" five years earlier. ""Scary Movie"" has the tag line, ""If you want to see the first movie of the year, rent this one."" I rented it hoping for the ""only movie in the whole 'Scary Movie' franchise'"" effect and right off the bat, I was disappointed.<br /><br />The entire ""Scary Movie"" saga was a major disappointment. I am a huge fan of the entire franchise, which includes ""The Evil Dead"", ""Legends of the Fall"", ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit-Moth"" and ""Planet Terror"". There were some exciting ideas - such as ""A Crazed Nurse"", and the fact that the Brain Freeze in ""Legends"" is true, and this event is true as well - but this movie isn't quite worthy of my attention. For a total of just ten minutes I don't get that 'Oh, that's awesome! And it's a little strange for a movie that has not yet been released.' What makes it really amazing is that this is the first movie that becomes the precursor to the zombie movies; which in my opinion were worth watching. This movie isn't quite "	1	0
"It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip ""Basic Instinct 2"" for its non-originality. This is the very definition of a waste of time. Without the genuineness of the first film, this film would have been a waste of time, and they should have never even bothered to release it. I understand that some people claim to find this movie great and rightfully so. But this kind of entertainment is not worth watching. At one point in the film, the evil mastermind says something about the world being run by ""helicids,"" and in order to compete with them, ""voodoo"" must be practiced. That is just stupid. Everything about this movie is stupid, and in the end, anyone who watches this movie will simply feel disgusted with themselves for not just paying attention but actually going to the trouble to watch this. If you can't get past the first film, you're better off watching some kids making movies, because otherwise, you'll have more in common with the dumb fat lesbians that ""Basic Instinct 2"" is making fun of.

Peter Ustinov plays an embezzler who is just getting out of jail when he goes to the house of a rich family. He later joins forces with his old college roommate Bobby (Ed Harris) and they get information that implicates an important professor. However, the first two characters they meet are the mafia (Jason Biggs) and their henchmen, he himself being the gang boss of the town (Michael Berryman). The movie begins in front of a judge in the S.F. Supreme Court and the three main characters: Ustinov, Harris, and Biggs return to the house. Suddenly, there's a struggle with the gang and Harris manages to escape. He gets the help of the Russian cops who believe Harris is guilty of murder and send him to prison, to keep him quiet about the case. In the meantime, the mobsters have killed a judge, a scientist, a lawyer, a doctor, and a secretary, while impersonating his rivals. Now, things are going badly for Harris. He is getting less and less talkative as the film goes on, and he starts to talk with an English accent. After several sequences involving an escaped convict, Harris leaves, and Ustinov now decides to take matters into his own hands. However, things aren't going so smoothly. David Ka	1	0
Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /><br />Director: Stuart Gordon <br /><br />Cast: Robson Green, Henry Schlegel, Rachel Louise, Terry Smith, Peter Rooney, James Shaw, Susan Olen Ray, Christopher Lee, Matthew Wyllie, Michael Cappapietro, Arjun Singh <br /><br />Running time: 75 minutes <br /><br />Bad story: <br /><br />Nicely directed and acted movie, with a good score from John Greenwood. The story is told in a very simple way. A small robot with unusual characteristics has to learn the morals of normal humans and build an identity for himself on human principles. <br /><br />It's well paced and interesting in parts. Robson Green makes a cool, and convincing android - who is not as human as his counterparts, but still has his own traits. A fine cast, good camera work and sound work. <br /><br />Overall, not a bad movie, but not exactly as good as some of his other works. Not a great movie, but with a nice following. 	0	1
"Del - ""You are the dumbest smart person I've ever met!"". Maybe this is the most representative of the characters in the film, like Cassie (one of the clowns) or the mice. The characters are easily explained and there are some funny moments, not the least of which is the clichéd affair when Paulo Jr. falls out of a chair and breaks his nose.<br /><br />Many people have compared this movie to Charles Band's Shaft, a good movie too, although it is not as funny, as the story is well-made and the storyline has some serious humor, namely the punchline - ""When I tell you my deepest secrets I'll make you my first little girl"". <br /><br />This movie was absolutely silly, very, very silly.<br /><br />I would recommend watching the movie only if you are absolutely sure of yourself.

"well, i said it all in the summary, i simpley love comedies and this is an average one, but it's not that bad i just thought it was so predictable, and i also thought that the movie was kind of boring. its the kind of movie that you think ""oh that's hilarious, why didn't the plot improve"", but then the whole movie starts to blow up and then you realize that your actually watchin it because of it. it was so predictable, and i laughed so hard at the end, but of course, that was just an attempt at predictability. like in any other sitcom, there are bad ones and there are good ones but its hard to say which is the best. but i honestly say that this movie is hard to beat and it would be a shame if its not a show to watch. i recommend that everyone watch it, and i would like to say that i really like this movie, but i can't recommend it at all, because the plot is so predictable. give it a go.

Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. Cloke has some great lines, and Busey is much like he was in the normal version. It doesn't even seem to matter that the movie is based on a TV series, which is more of a shame because I think the storyline was excellent and so the intention was good. Don't see this movie, stay tuned for more such movies. 1/10. 	0	1
Had this movie been made just a few years later, it probably would have been a good addition to the Tom & Jerry series. Nowadays, if you want to watch a fun Tom & Jerry movie, you've got to try The Jerry Lewis Show. The only thing that needs to be said here is that those who are watching this movie from one of the comments here have probably watched this movie many times before and they can say what they like about it. If you just have a brain (or haven't been following the Tom & Jerry series to the letter) and enjoy an enjoyable Tom & Jerry movie, stay away from this movie. It is better to leave Tom & Jerry alone. 	1	0
Okay. Yes, this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors and lousy acting. But that's not what this movie is about. It's about a guy who does some yoga in a gym, goes to a religious festival, and generally lives his life with the help of a spiritual counselor. He's lonely, depressed, and in love with his daughter and the powerful spiritual adviser of his choosing. All of this is represented by a character named Ethan, played by Jack Black. He, like every movie character played by the same actor, is so unsympathetic, he becomes the foil for the main character, Ethan. His sadistic ways are more shocking than necessary (even though we know by the end of the movie that Ethan was born with functional dyslexia), but that's a part of Black's appeal. In the end, Ethan saves the day for the community, though the people who live in the movie's neighborhood feel just as mad and resentful as he does. There is no sense of redemption in this movie, and it's quite sad. I wouldn't put it on a hard-core cult list, but for anyone who feels somewhat messed up and upset by the characters on a regular basis, this movie is worth a look. 	1	0
"In Hazzard County, Georgia, cousins Bo and Luke Duke (Scott, Jason Lee and Michelle Carter) are major football players. They do not have much else to do. They have learned to play football to earn money, but they also have fun when they are out on the field. After Bo is killed, Luke turns into a crazy, drunk boy who runs around the street threatening people. Bo discovers that Bo's sister is raped by a drug dealer who was helping Bo for free. With a few friends she helps Luke pay the $20 to the drug dealer. Bo's school, Pulasky High, is very much supportive of Luke and wants to help him play football again.<br /><br />I was not really convinced by any of the plot elements. What made me laugh is when the ""drug dealer"" heard the story of Bo and Luke's story and ran from the school and was not arrested. I didn't know what that meant. At the end I still didn't know what the plot was. However, once I found out it was really really bad, I was really glad I did not pay for it. I don't really know how they became famous, but it's safe to say that they had their moments. Unfortunately, that doesn't really matter. I actually enjoyed this movie. It was funny, had som"	0	1
Chris Rock stars in this remake of Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait as one of the US Government's most talented brain surgeons. He takes over a beautiful young woman's apartment in an effort to repair the damage done to her heart by the virus the virus was sent to. Not long after the war breaks out he meets his new patient Jane (Emma Roberts) by chance and falls for her as well. They continue on and so does Chris, never looking back and then one day the doctor discovers that Jane's body is being subjected to the same treatment as his. It turns out she can read and write, communicate with animals and understand many basic human emotions. Chris travels to Africa and soon finds that the very same virus he cured has infected him as well and he goes after the virus' main supplier.<br /><br />The problem with Heaven Can Wait is that it is simply a rehash of the original story, which had its moments of great creativity but other than that is nothing. Even with the feminist scene thrown in the story has no substance and the half decent story is short lived. The film seems to have been written for Chris Rock's talents but rather than giving him a unique vehicle to show off his talents it makes him work with nothing to work with. The writer certainly shows none of the talent he has shown i	1	0

"If John Thaw had never played ""Morse"", ""Kavanagh"", or starred in Billy Connelly's ""The Road"", it would have been a different movie.<br /><br />Having first seen this when it first came out, I can still remember its success and its cult following. When it first came out it was practically unknown in the States and really hard to get your hands on. Most reviewers either forgot or thought it was new. It didn't make any money and its major star(s) quit the studio that had made it in the past. It had been a long road to fame for both Thaw and Branagh (who'd never seen a movie before), so when they gave it to the new production company the lights finally came on and things went south really fast.<br /><br />Things aren't as they should be. Instead of a bright future, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" now has the reputation of being unfunny and a comedy drama. Forget it. I'd rather see Michael Keaton on the set of ""Ray"" with the liquor-soaked wife. The film now has the reputation of being boring, boring and boring.<br /><br />That is the movie's biggest flaw. Nothing it does really comes close to ""Eyes Wide Shut"".

After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the perfect remake for this film. The film has the same general style of the original film, but on a much shorter amount of time. They even did the same movies in two different cities, which is a good thing. With the amount of gore and nudity that was in this remake, I thought the blood would get an inch thicker and appear just as thick as in the original film. I thought the music by John Williams, Cesar Romero, Gregory Hines, and Richard Crenna was pretty good, as well. Overall, I think this is another film that should have been taken out of the theaters before they released it. It is a much better movie if someone actually watched it first. If you ever watch it, and it seems too gruesome to be real, or you find yourself not caring what happens to the characters, I suggest you get it off the shelf and watch it again, because even though it seems more realistic, it's just your opinion if it is. I just gave it a 1 because the extra gore and violence is just too much. 	0	1
"True, it does not follow the book very closely, but it follows some pretty close to the book. The rules in the book are exactly what the movie does not follow--all the supporting characters have been cut from the movie. <br /><br />The only good thing about the movie is Ellen Barkin as Tim, but she does not stand a chance against Simon who comes straight out of the book. Also, the fight scenes between the movie and the book are very, very poor.<br /><br />The movie is some of the worst writing and acting I have seen in a long time, except for Robert Loggia's ""Air Force One"". But if you have not read the book, you need not worry about this movie. If you do have the book, the movie does not really do a good job of adapting it, even though the characters in the book are certainly different. If you are not going to read the book, skip this one--it is a waste of time.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie that will take you to the book and make you think a little bit, look no further than ""Spaceballs."" It's a great movie. "	1	0
Simon Pegg plays a rude crude and often out of character clueless villain who disobeys his superior for no reason and his son's grandmother. After at first trying to help the aged hapless wife of the driver and her husband we begin to learn that he is a lunatic and that the ageing wife might well have a blind daughter who will soon be brought back to life from some remote island on some hellish island. He uses some over the top smears of children, raves about how lonely he is and how no-one can help him in the very cruel way his fellow employee is trying to.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, but the first 20 minutes of this rubbish can really stand alone and feel like they're in the other one but trust me it's not.

There is also a little monster from outer space and a flight of stairs that go up at a random rate to a God damn cliff.

After defeating it, the evil Dr. Kukui is defeated and the evil trainers go their separate ways.<br /><br />The evil trainers do not go anywhere and battle each other, using skills such as freeze, poison, thunder, rage etc.. later on and they leave with the Dr. Kukui in the beginning of the second half.<br /><br />The idea is to get the wrong villain and the second movie is awesome with about the same number of fights as the first one but the plot is ridiculous.<br /><br />I have to say that this sequel (Shinobi Warriors) was much better than the first, the dragon pokemon trainer was a real step up in skill level, and all the lines of dialog and the fights were more realistic.<br /><br />My 4 out of 10 is based on the new dragon trainer, also in Shinobi Warriors, (combo game) the transformation of the evil villain and the special moves and effects are great. And the fighting scenes were awesome. 6/10 	0	1
this was a real guilt pleasure ... i saw the movie yesterday night on that small local station and it was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.it just so happens that on that same morning my brother had another show that was not a good one so we both did watch it together that night.the plot was good as was the acting but the ending sucked way too much and had really nothing to do with anything. i am not sure if it is a hate crime or murder but the real value of the movie is to show you the person who just broke your heart.one of those movies you should watch with your family or even better enjoy with friends and then sing and dance to. be warned.... there are very deep characters at all levels that you may be in shock when watching this and for the most part people talk a lot about it and the plot is a complete joke.the biggest problem with this movie is that the acting wasn't good enough to give a normal person a laugh.some of the other movies that i have seen on local i can even name the character that played the bad guy and that character is still alive today because of this movie.though some of the acting was done well it wasn't good enough to make me feel that much sympathy for those involved.and i would suggest no	1	0

"Ever notice how in his later movies Burt Reynolds' laugh had changed over time? He was still deeply sweet and honest, but he took some of his earlier adult comedies a little too far in that last movie.

Like Reynolds, Stewart has great chemistry with Robert Downey Jr., and these two go way back. "	0	1
"i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it was hilarious seeing people use them. this movie is my way of saying that i hate thicks. (and pretty much all others) what is the story? no i'm not kidding, there is no story, just random guys with the misfortune of dating each other, getting mad at each other, all over each other and blah blah blah. these guys appear in the beginning and end of the movie. there is no ""this person likes me now"" or ""that person is now in love with me"" you never know why they end up together,they just happen to become friends. and then they jump ship for good. not only is the story bad, but everything about this movie was bad. but i digress. the people who rated this movie the 10 and it's supposed to be some classic are either in love with the acting or with the girls, but i find it odd that people hate this movie so much. a couple of my favorite movies...the remade hit man and 2 nite core, are much better. and if you want to see the best movies of all time let me tell you the 12 year old and the ghost in the castle (among other things) is in my top 5 of all time.

This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for awhile. Now, I am not one to believe in long-winded plots, so I would have liked to have seen a bit more of it.

"So far after week two of ""The lone of Beauty"" I haven't lost any interest. The writing is perfect, the characters are oh so well developed, the direction perfect, the editing is brilliant. I've got some issues with the direction, but I see the current flow of the story. Plot development isn't enough, character development isn't enough, for me you need enough payoff and tension to keep me watching. The story isn't ""corny"" or ""so, it has characters that survive and it's all going to be pretty much perfect,"" I just love the storyline in this story. I enjoyed the flow of the story and the plot itself was intriguing and funny. ""The lone of beauty"" is one movie that may stand out for its excellent direction and production values, the writers certainly deserve some better support. "	0	1
You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself up with videos of himself on his computer. But he can't help himself from making video after video of himself in this bizarre, bizarre bit-part role in this weirdly dated, bizarrely bad, but surprisingly entertaining country/western spoof of 1920s England, called White Heat. Here, Williams plays Bill Henry, one of the political prisoners who gets political out of prison years after being released. When the police, as usual, find him, he's given a new job. He works for a top lawyer in England who really does mean to exonerate him of all wrong doing, but he actually enjoys doing it. Unbeknownst to him, his nemesis is actually Blackie Hart (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who keeps murdering local people. This is a clever premise, but Williams and Meyers fall over each other with the inherent stupidity of this comic character. While the films premise is somewhat amusing, it is seriously lacking in comedy. Everything has a just about low budget feel to it; the characters are ill-conceived and just trying to make the pieces work. Williams comes across as very buff, which would be normal for an actor as old as he is. He's played to a tee here; instead of being an entertaining old white gu	1	0
"Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium and fashioned this psychological horror film. It's as much a darkly comic drama as a psychological horror one, without the added complications of Bo Derek and Charles Boyer's musical score. The camera is never in the film's path, and rarely ever pulls back to make any sort of shot of the dreamscape or any aspect of the crazy house and its inhabitants. The house itself seems to exist for the sole purpose of a child's grotesque fantasy.<br /><br />Jodie Foster (the co-writer of films such as ""From Here to Eternity"") plays Nancy Mankins, a happily married mother of three with an even more happy-go-lucky husband (Charlie Craig). One evening, Jodie, determined to ruin her husband and their job, jumps into a shopping mall car with a knife.

I kind of liked The Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break...she can't act, can't direct, and has to go through scenes of semi-permanent nudity to get through a movie. The plot is sort of weird. How on earth do you have a doctor trying to find a prostitute with Down Syndrome and a priest trying to find the only girl with Down Syndrome who likes him? But more weird than that, the plot gets all confusing and just gets more weird, and when she finally discovers it, it's just a complete travesty of a mess.<br /><br />If I liked The Lonely Lady, I'd have given it 8 stars but it was so incredibly bad, I just gave it zero stars. But even if you don't like Pia, the supporting actors aren't as good. The only funny scene in the movie is when the priest is stoned and the confused actor's character thinks he's seeing a ghost.<br /><br />3/10 	1	0
This film made John Glover a star. Alan Raimy is really believable as one of the lifeguard workers. But the best thing about this movie is that it's so hilarious. The actors and actresses are all really likable. But for one small reason, the way the movie has been done, Glover has almost taken over. On one particular night, he goes out with his girlfriend when there's no lifeguard available. He doesn't hear a thing. He gets out of the lifeguard shack and climbs up a tree. That's all. He gets there, and suddenly the trees around him are falling. Glover doesn't say anything. He just walks over and stares up at the stars. The first one is close enough for him to reach and hit her. When she takes off, the tree snaps back up, and he can't reach her. She dies. And the death is a joke. The death was not funny in any way. I won't say if Glover's performance in this film is worth it because he's a really good actor. He's completely over the top in it. But one must remember that this is just a movie. Even though it's being made by John Glover, it's still John Glover playing a human being. It's not a comedy or even a dramatic piece. There's just n	1	0
"In short, the movie had a little bit of a rough introduction (there was a stand-in for Philo Vance, for instance), and then it got off on the wrong foot. However, the choice of actors for the series was an excellent one, and the package itself was very well crafted. Thank goodness for a Director's Cut. On a couple of occasions, ""Tarzan and His Mate"" appeared to be an adaptation of a Charles Perrault story, a real talent missing from many today's film versions of the classic book. However, the passivity of Perrault's print, coupled with the striking photography of Ray Harryhausen and Janet Corsé, made ""Tarzan"" a whole lot easier to digest. Unfortunately, most film adaptations (and even a ""Tarzan movie"") are more or less contrived messes in terms of story, acting, and dialogue. ""Tarzan"" had its moments. John Ritter looked great and plays a fairly well-developed character. Mark Twain was in a fair bit of company, and Charles B. Hart was a proper presence as the Master of the Tarzan House. Perhaps most enjoyable of all was the silly plot, which involved the mysterious tribe of apes that look nothing like the apes of the novel and almost resemble Bambi (an ape wh"	0	1
"""Triumph of Love"" is proof that not every Comédie-Française author has sunk her teeth into the life of the landlady. The story tells us the details of a recent theatre production of Macbeth, in which the audience was supposed to watch the acting of the other members of the cast. The Acting was magnificent. You have to admit that it was a bit painful for the actors.<br /><br />These characters are all widowed, having never met one another. I do not wish to offend any of you, but the author of the novel who has this tragic love affair with this landlady reminds me of some famous characters in the novel. Sir Gawain is about the same in the form of Lord Rochester.<br /><br />Some people believe that the novel-saying Shakespeare married his way to the throne, without considering the facts of the story, when in fact his wife is never mentioned. <br /><br />While speaking of your ideology, do you believe that the constitution of France was really the best and most stable in the history of the world?

"At the beginning of the film we watch May and Andrew smashing each other's heads on a rock. That is it. We've heard the movie for about two seconds. It does not happen. The film then cuts to when May is ""presiding"" of a rally for people in the cafeteria of her building. (Even though she's already in the building.) She speaks passionately about how she wants to bring people together. When May is finished, I turned the TV to the morning news. Everything was on. The director and her team had shown us a very shallow and unsatisfying movie. They were ruining an excellent concept with the sole purpose of giving us nothing more than an experience of a very short time. How dishonest can one be? This concept was originally promoted on ""C-Span"". That is, an American video channel who is supposed to be important, but is in reality just a bunch of people having their heads smashed with a screwdriver. They couldn't find a worthy subject to promote on TV. It is much more dangerous to show a Nazi attack on a Russian city. But no one could take that idea seriously. So they focused on the Soviet Union. Then they had the worst film ever made. Could it be that the American propaganda industry is even worse than their Soviet counterparts? Well, then w"	1	0
"I firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who criticised this movie. The old school audience (interviewed and after seeing this) wanted to see a credible first part of a multi-part movie. They wanted to see some real actor in a first part that might even have a semblance of credibility and originality. However, you don't see any of that here.<br /><br />Now to the reason why they could have such a lack of credibility, in my opinion. Firstly, the whole reason this was made in the first place is to hype it up for the big screen, namely to attract another studio to make a horror film (quite literally). Now the originality of the early 80's gore movies were pretty extraordinary. Most of them made it into a ""cult classic"", which in this case is the equivalent of a dead actor in a ""cult classic"" movie. The difference between a cult classic and a typical ""horror"" movie is that it is usually well-produced and genuinely scary, and has a decent cast. In short, the originality of the 80's gore movies is much more suited to an era where horror was parading about more like a highly restricted social atmosphere than a cinematic medium. Plus, an era is a period that hasn't really changed much since the 70'"	0	1
"I usually comment only on movies that I like, figuring that nobody else out there will. This time, however, I will have to tackle a movie that I don't like, because I'll have to rate it one point higher than if I hadn't come to the conclusion that it was a lousy movie.<br /><br />Now, there is one aspect of this movie that's extremely funny: the absurd sense of humor that pops up repeatedly as the movie goes on, and even becomes an unintentional extension of the message that the director is trying to convey. The humor is genuinely bizarre in a very ""adult"" kind of way, as in it's intentionally goofy nature and doesn't try to be comical in any way. So if you're looking for something especially light and gory that seems bizarre and comical, you may find something of interest here. You can actually see a substantial amount of blood from the opening sequence. As it is a thriller, as mentioned, it is supposed to be scary, though it's the film's tone that's so strangely and absurdly low-keyed that it actually comes off as harmless. As such, there is very little at all that I would consider ""bad"" or offensive in the slightest. The ending, I believe, was deliberate, as it sets up the audienc"	0	1
"When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out (years ago) I was very disappointed. The problem with the movie was not the plot, it was that the entire movie was taken from a TV program that was done by TV and then on to a video tape and then on to videotape again. And the movie doesn't even come close to live action but rather CGI effects that were added in after the fact. So why on earth would you buy a movie, with some CGI effects anyway, and then think it is ""edgy"" or ""art""? I bought this movie for my 4 year old son who loves it and is pretty sure it will become an instant classic. I have to say that at age 10 or 11 my son couldn't wait for the movie to be over so we could go to the video store and purchase a copy for him. I mean, the giant robot and the terrible looking flying robots are right up his alley.<br /><br />I give this movie 10 out of 10. "	1	0
This movie was awesome!! (Not quite as good as the original,) And there was a lot of cool action that was really interesting. <br /><br />It turned out to be a cross between a Death Wish movie and the Dark Knight Rises. The new version has only 1 make-up job (Maybe 2) on Bruce Wayne. There is also 3 scenes with Christopher Reeves (Jesse Spencer) going after the cell phone store. That's not good. But, the weapons department is alright. (The fight scenes and the car chase were fun, and looked good.) <br /><br />We got to see some cool news footage to boot.<br /><br />I can't really rate this movie too highly. There are too many flaws and I'm a very nitpick gal. I would have given it an average, but they could have at least made a couple of the scenes more interesting. <br /><br />Wayne will learn a lesson, don't go around telling Batman's side. This one could have been a better one. 	0	1
There are two movie experiences I will always cherish. The first involves watching one of my favorite movies. The second involves watching a poor movie just to see if it was truly bad. My first movie experience is when I was 4 years old and I caught it on a country channel (IN THE MONEY). After watching it, I remember thinking that this was one of the worst movies ever made. It has some truly awful lines, terrible editing, and was just plain bad. I have seen versions of this movie in other places and I can't believe they still have it (as far as I know).<br /><br />It was the 50's and movies like this were what made the time. It was only logical that these movies should be repeated ad nauseum. My 2nd movie experience involves watching a complete piece of garbage like Fastway 2 (the original) or S.W.A.T. (the sequel). These are movies which have something wrong with them, but are just horrible to watch. The only thing that makes them even slightly entertaining is the bad acting, but at least they have some plot. Never will I watch another Fastway movie (as far as I know).<br /><br />The worst part of all of this is that my childhood friends have both seen and enjoyed thi	1	0
"Says Andy: ""Nobody gets hurt, everybody wins."" Before he says it Andy kills one of the bad guys and all of a sudden the bad guys become the heroes. This is supposed to be the most boring big-screen film ever made. But at least it's not a campy disaster such as the sequels to Alien (1979) or Aliens (1982).<br /><br />Sounds interesting? Well, you'd have to be extremely gullible and open-minded to take a bad movie seriously. Movies like The Usual Suspects (1990) and Friday the 13th (1985) go on for a whopping 45 minutes before being stopped by a virus. None of these films were good and I have to say that no blockbuster movie made me laugh out loud more than Friday the 13th, Part III.<br /><br />The weird thing is that while it's a stupid and uninteresting movie, it had a kind of essence that made it somehow respectable. As someone who thinks a lot about the psychology of cinema, I was perfectly fine with it. The atmosphere, the violence, the effects, and the physical effects all make this a movie worth watching.<br /><br />So, all in all, if you enjoy low-budget campy horror, it's worth watching.

"Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This made my weekend so much fun, I didn't even want to get up for dinner! There's some really hilarious lines. First, Tom goes to see his sister in law and gets the shock of his life. When his driver says, 'Go ahead', Tom is astounded and says: ""No, Mr. Stooges. You've got to get in the van!"" The van is so huge, he and the driver knock over everything in the way. Then, you have the climactic skit where they ride into the den of a rabid dog and step on the gas! While we're laughing at this we see that the'stooge' jumps out and picks up the package on the sidewalk! One of the funniest scenes is the one where the three Stooges set up a machine to capture a voodoo god, who gets out of his pocket and drops a treasure chest to their rival, Yuriko. The Stooges call the voodoo god 'the five-fingered god' and he doesn't leave the house. They even send a horse out to scare the god out of Yuriko. What a relief. But wait, there's more!

This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this comment here on IMDb, the film was made in 1989. The action happens during a murder trial. In order to see this film in an official context, you need to see it in its original form, and not just in the remastered version released by Disney, because they tried to hide the film's plot and execution.<br /><br />By this I mean that most of the film is simply a series of talking heads debating (possibly against each other) about the various issues that pertain to the trials. Though they're all talking, none of them come across as particularly interesting or likable.<br /><br />The only two people you'll recognize are Chuck Connors and Bobby Cannavale, who in a clever nod to Seagal, are the worst criminals the film ever had the good sense to have cast. The others are all stock criminal types you've come to expect to see on the scene, though not in any specific roles.<br /><br />This is a mixed bag. It's an effective film that does not feel too modern or too dated. On the other hand, I really didn't get what's going on with Jean Arthur. Her character is entirely unsympathetic and unbearably shrill, which ma	1	0

"Once upon a time Hollywood produced live-action, G-rated movies without women actors and directorial decisions. And they were often really good. Ealing comedies like ""The Music Man"" and ""Hairspray"" are classic examples. But when the 1970s came, the studio chief -- J. Edgar Hoover -- decreed the studio must produce G-rated movies with women in them.<br /><br />By 1986, that mission had been accomplished. Joss Ackland, the studio boss and staunch liberal, had created the G-rated 8 1/2, released in theaters that year, that was enthusiastically reviewed by critics and fans alike. That year also marked the birth of the modern-day ""Hollywood Code"", which legally prohibited films with female leads from showing in theaters, a regulation established long before the Ealing comedies became wildly popular and profitable. But, still, the corporation couldn't simply decide to leave its female stars out of these comedies: Those same movies, too, were classified as such by the ""Code."" So, in many ways, the 8 1/2 was ""Hollywood Code 2.0"" -- its clever censorship was essentially aimed at ensuring that a certain percentage of movies released on television that year -- that is, the G-rated movies released in theaters -- included at least on"	1	0
The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Jessie - set out to make a movie that would make us think: 'Maybe, just maybe, we've found the perfect American family film to watch over and over again.' What a brilliant idea! I can't quite believe that the Hanson brothers failed to realise the meaning of their film (in my opinion). The DVD extras do not give any hint as to the general theme or the plot. It's not that a lot is lacking; perhaps it is the special features, but the film does not have a coherent beginning or middle. The movie is incomprehensible in parts and goes on for an eternity. Well written characters are introduced in this monotonous work of fiction.<br /><br />Well played by Andy in his vivacious innocence but half-way through the film we realise that it's not just a funny look at single parents, but as a national institution; we start to wonder whether we're watching a bunch of dumb 15-year-olds or a very neurotic 35-year-olds. In this respect, the film looks like a social commentary; whether it's parents becoming detached or institutions becoming increasingly redundant and on the verge of collapse is of utmost importance. Over-indulgent/beloved parents spend their last hours enjoying the beauty o	1	0
Serum starts as Eddie (Derek Phillips) is delighted to learn that one of his son's future patients (as well as his best friend and Uncle) has been killed. Eddie's friend Eric (Josh Martin) goes to check on him and finds that Eddie is no longer in the hospital. When he wakes up he learns that the patient has died and Eric is still alive and there are rumours about him but nothing is revealed and he seems dead.<br /><br />The little-known Eric discovers that Eddie's case is over and is told that he has to go to Italy to obtain his inheritance.

Eric falls in love with a shopgirl named Beth (Liz Black) who tries to save him by telling the truth to the doctor (Pierce Brosnan). Once there she falls in love with him but gets into an argument with her mother because she likes her money. When Stacey leaves the room Eric is taken to the morgue and becomes ill. He shows up at the hospital where there are people waiting to see him and the wife of the patient called Anna (Anastasia De Angelis) is upset because she thinks that she has paid for her husban	0	1
"""Three Daring Daughters"" is a sickly sweet, rose-colored look at how adolescent ambition can lead to love, beauty, and sex. The children are creepy, especially the children in their family, who are unlikely to be interesting in any way. But they are definitely more interesting in the dark world of the world they travel through than in a mainstream plot line. After a couple of meals of toast they spend their first night in this strange, natural country where the Dutch have come to control the ""heritage"". You wonder if the reason for this is to make the characters fun, or because it feels like an excursion to adulthood. These characters act like adults, they make jokes about college kids and their teachers, and have their own mothers.<br /><br />While we never really get to know the characters much better, the story is very good and presents a complex plot of coming-of-age and adult love. If you want to see a beautiful, troubled childhood, see this film. "	0	1

"I'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend who lives in Canada. I don't know what he was talking about; maybe I'll see it one day. I wasn't expecting much, but I was blown away by this film. The story, the acting, the script, etc. Just brilliant. I thought Haggard would be in it; he doesn't seem to be in it at all. The description here is correct. The movie is about a very annoying maid that hangs around a main building and is never really let out. The way she does things is really sick and I hated her so much that I began to hate her myself.<br /><br />I was so excited that I rented this movie (surprise!) for free from the library! I paid nothing at all, and I was so impressed by the movie that I gave the rental a ""10"". I feel bad that I wasted my money on a horror flick; it didn't really have anything to do with the rating I gave it. I'd give it a 10, but I'm not at all convinced that it's going to live up to my expectations.<br /><br />To the author of the comment above: sorry to hear about that.

Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. He's a disgusting screenwriter who lives in a free world and has no respect for the art form he is supposed to be based upon. The script is stupid, the acting is awful, the shooting is bad. The story and the acting are what make the movie so scary and sick, but even then the audience is pretty weak for that matter.<br /><br />By the way, Verhoeven really does have an interesting case. In reality people who hire him to direct have no business having his name attached to a film they are screening. If he would have bothered to research his ideas for this film he would have gotten much better results. But the people he has hired to helm this disaster just wish he didn't hire them. They are a bunch of vapid, pathetically self-absorbed, Hollywood types that only have themselves to blame.<br /><br />What did you expect from a Judgement Day sequel to a totally and utterly awful story about a retarded father and a zombie child in a move to vent and give his son a life?

After apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his wife (played by John Stapleton), and leading the police to the flat where the murder took place, Cliff (Stapleton) takes a suspect in his friend (Robert Patrick) and they work to find out what really happened. Suspicious that someone has been sending innocent people's DNA to the station (to cover their tracks), director Albert Pyun decided to make this weird, unreformatted film. It is a shame too, considering that the cult of Robert Patrick is so large and so well-received. Nevertheless, this is not a masterpiece. First of all, we are introduced to Robert Patrick (who later went on to be a big success on Lifetime's reality series Undercover Boss), who works in the K-Mart department at the high-end department store where Cliff is arrested and then released, still on a probation order. Here we are introduced to Mr. Patrick, who speaks with a horrible English accent, making it hard for us to understand what is going on and what is going on to him. We are also introduced to him as a suspect, just as we did with Cliff, who we have seen put a gun to the head of the culprit. And then, on top of that, Robert Patrick meets the girl (played by Joan Alle	0	1
I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him done justice on this low budget series is a treat. Vosloo does what he does best. He teaches the children what to do in a scene. There is no fighting and of course you can't see what it is he is teaching but no matter that, you're learning the basics. This series really comes alive once you start watching it. These kids are so intelligent it is amazing. The laugh track is a real highlight too. Throughout the show the director takes a big step back and gives the children something to relate to. The kids and aunties just grow on you and it really makes you appreciate these adults more. This is a show that will bring laughs and tears to anyone's heart. Don't even think of it as entertainment... you can't just pass it off as a kids show. It is simply a very touching story. If you have never seen this series or the grandfather finale you need to see this, otherwise you will probably think Arnold Vosloo is the greatest role in the history of movie making. 	0	1
"**WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER**<br /><br />If you can get by the movie premise that Russia is as bad as its media makes it out to be, then I suggest you give this movie a try. The plot is not great, but it's very entertaining. There is a very good cast and it's a pity that many are completely uninterested in what this movie is about. David Strathairn had the opportunity to better himself in ""Castle"" (2006) and he didn't. On top of this, the film is shot in widescreen and this is a shame. Perhaps they should have shot the documentary as well. At least it was shot in Australia.<br /><br />I have to say that at certain points I thought this film would end after 20 minutes. I was hoping it would get a little more interesting. Unfortunately it was way too long. "	0	1
"Inspector Gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon. I love Gadget's adventures. The story is pretty good. The animation is good. Just the names of the characters makes you want to get your hands on the original comics. If you don't see that, I don't know what to tell you. Anyhow, the reviews here say that Inspector Gadget is better than ""Cool Gadget"". Well, if you really want to see how bad the animation is, then you should have the original cartoons. Gadget's first appearance is one of the most incredibly awful moments of the cartoon. Look at it. That is Inspector Gadget's head falling off. In fact, look closely at his arm. There is a lot of blood on his arm. Can you believe it? Because this is still a part of this cartoon. The New Adventures of Inspector Gadget starts the series off with ""Bounce"" the elephant. The plot is not good. And all of the animation looks like it has been painted. Don't get me wrong. The characters in this cartoon are great. The Gadget of the beginning is a real hero. He can read people's minds. And one of his many adventures is to crack into a bank and steal $100,000.00 from the safe in the back of the vault.<br /><br />While thi"	0	1
When a man who doesn't have Alzheimer's can't remember how to tie his shoes, he's not going to get the money to take care of a sick family. You'd think that after the amazing original A Walk on the Moon, we'd be moving on to a new cycle of British movies, instead of wasting our time. Some members of the audience on the Tower Stage had managed to spot this film about as early as the beginning of previews, so I had my hopes up, and being somewhat above grade level, I've decided to give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Normally I'd give this film a one or two star rating, but all the negative comments and the low votes made me throw this film down to one star. These are people that I saw standing outside the theater, that I just weren't very eager to see.

I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when they presume that Shakespeare's works are some sort of historical source. The best examples are the classic plays of Polanski, as well as those of Gere, whom I love; but in these cases, the results are overwrought, and unnecessarily misleading.<br /><br />One of the most pleasant aspects of this movie was its appreciation of Shakespeare's dialogue.

Lynch. The man has some really great stuff! He knows how to score and it's all right. It's this nightmarish combination of cgi-thriller, live action, horror, and horror on film that makes this film an exercise in satisifaction. It's a brilliantly ambitious horror movie that I suggest anyone watch. All the beautiful bits from the Japanese originals will come through as well as some of the dialogue from the Japanese language used in the film, and there are some funky camera-work and interesting set-ups. For some reason, Lynch just loves making movies and this is definitely one of his better efforts. I give it 8 out of 10. 	0	1
"The only part lacking in this movie is Shue's part as Bianca. He's on the board of directors. He's an actor who's taken an idea and incorporated it into his own film. The idea is great, but he doesn't take the time to make it good. It's dull. Even though it is shot on film, it's still shot on video and captures some of the scenes that made it so great in the first place. The feeling of the ""improvising"" portions of the film is quite good, and I really liked the way Shue manipulated his characters. This is definitely the film that helped start the last wave of magical realism that followed in the 80s, and is still making strides today.<br /><br />*** out of ***** "	1	0
"If you've ever seen the trailer for the film ""The Hills Have Eyes 2,"" you know that it's set in the same world as this one. It's not exactly a story about a teen called Sam (Tim Roth) who gets arrested and forced to make a case about some sort of 'eco-terrorist.' But, like ""American Beauty,"" the message is similar. Sam discovers that his father was one of the people who constructed this 'eco-terrorist' who was, in fact, not crazy at all, but just a bit of a fraud. The same lies that society tells us we should be suppressing are actually making us more evil. That's why Sam ends up coming to the United States, in his secret guise as an activist who wants to stop them from doing it. I felt sorry for John Cusack in ""American Beauty"" because he was like, 'I have so much to say. I don't need you to do me justice. You don't need a plot to make me sound sensible.'

I first saw this film over 25 years ago on TV when it first came out. I'm not sure if I had just caught up on it as an adult but I do remember that it was a film that got me thinking about life, death, and the value of life. I was intrigued by what might happen to these characters who were filled with such wisdom and humanity and wondered what these people would do if they were put in danger. When I got to the end, I felt empathy for everybody involved, not just for the main character, who was a transvestite woman but all the others, none of whom made it out alive. This film tells about such stories and it has a very real point of view.<br /><br />All in all, a film to be avoided unless you're a big fan of the Beat Generation, if you want to go down a 'philosophy of life' path. I really wish the producers would get some luck and learn a bit more about medical ethics since this was a film that kept me going. But, for me, I did get so interested in the characters and so involved in their stories that I lost interest in any way, shape or form with any of them. 	1	0
A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine gave me this movie. It is another account of the demise of the 1970s rock n' roll movement. It's been almost 8 years and I have not yet received a review. Anyway, back to the story... My friend and I were living in Austin, TX during the 70s and we stopped by a local movie theatre to watch the free movie. This is the movie theatre that Pavarotti was having his first run-in with the law. Pavarotti had just been arrested in Hamburg and because of his presence in the crowd, many bands started fighting back. What's that? You think so? Well, Pavarotti went on to battle the likes of the Stooges, the Who, the Who II and the Who Get It and the Stooges fans set the stage for a decent debate about how bad a movie Pavarotti had been in, how much he deserved to die and who the real hero was. The question about the real hero was the lead singer of the legendary bar band the Stooges and Pavarotti was as much of a WONDERFUL comedian as he was a powerful performer.

"It's refreshing to see a movie that you think will just fade away like ""The Green Mile,"" ""Back to the Future"" or even ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" is so popular that it just might have a life of its own. I honestly think this movie will be loved by fans of every kind. All it took was Christopher Lloyd's acting ability to earn it a place on my ""Best of"" list. In a way, Lloyd's brilliance as a character actor just made it all the more incredible. I agree with someone else who said that the screenplay for this movie was 'boring.' It wasn't bad at all, but in a way, it made Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey seem completely unbelievable. That, to me, makes it a good movie. I felt sorry for Lloyd after he won a Golden Globe, which was a huge breakthrough in my movie book. That, and Brad Pitt's transformation from Army brat to really decent actor.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that it's so slow. It just doesn't make sense.

Noni Hazelhurst's performance is otherwise unremarkable; it's as if she was written to play a young Mary Woronov, and they deliberately thought that she was too old. <br /><br />To be fair, the only two adults in the film are Hanna Stone (without her whiny Scottish accent) and Rani Harvey (with her piping voice). If they had played them in the context of a typical film, they would have sufficed.<br /><br />The movie is also one of the few in which Van Damme actually plays a crime-fighting cop; his sole purpose is to lay low his nemesis (who is played by a flamboyant Olivier Assayas), and does so effectively. It's a very entertaining flick indeed. 	0	1
"I love the book, ""Jane Eyre"" and have seen many versions since then. The reason I've seen this version is because of the actors - and her friends. This movie is not great, but it is still good with the excellent actors and the wonderful story. I would highly recommend it. "	0	1
"Well, I suppose the good news concerning William Winckler's 2001 movie Labyrinth was that it was the first live-action film I had ever seen from a British director. The movie's American editing, although bad, was still pretty good. And it was pretty fun. I had actually heard of the story prior to watching it, and my impression was that it was very connected to the 1950 classic horror novel by Hans Christian Andersen. The early scenes set in one of the seemingly remote locations, the castle itself, depicted the place that was so much of the author's vision. The castle was visually stunning. The visual effect sequences which explained to me some of the conceits and symbolism (such as the macabre and wry remarks made about another woman at the beginning of the movie, and the ""Savior"", mentioned by the old man, in another sequence) were excellent. The only negative I have about the film is that the direction was too plain and the dialogue lacks any edge or meaning. "	0	1
"Released two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning movie about WWII stereotypes was the first in a series of movies that would take on much bigger and more complex roles in movies and on television. By the time I was six I had already seen the movie ""The Mating Game,"" with George Cukor as Dr. Pfeiffer, ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" starring Joan Crawford, and ""Love Actually,"" with Joan Crawford, all of which had been done a year earlier.<br /><br />The movie I'm most familiar with is the one starring Bernsen and Rhys Ifans (""An American in Paris,"" ""Vera,"" ""Paris, Texas""). In ""Villa Rangold,"" Eleanor Parker played Dr. Sheppard, an ambitious and loving, and utterly naïve aristocrat, but was then able to marry a fabulously wealthy man, Philip N. Noble. In ""Paris, Texas,"" Ms. Parker and Mr. Noble were engaged, but the writers had to insert the marrying party in a French prison so that the story could be told in an American setting. However, that was not the case in ""Paris, Texas."" Not only was Dr. Pfeiffer both annoying and overtly superior, but he was no more or less sympathetic than anyone else in the movie. Her husban"	1	0
where would one start a review of the film Snitch'd? well anyway i give it a two because it is one of the very few films i have seen that only got worse with every passing day. this is for one reason only.. my partner and i were so into the film he even thought of ripping it apart.. when the plot finally revealed himself all of a sudden our minds went numb from shock and sympathy and returned to the film.. anyone with even a basic knowledge of film, or film theory will realise that the film is nothing but a few students taking a day on their day off and creating a film. wow do i ever wish i could have given it two stars instead of one. there is a point in the film where all it takes is one tiny instance of visual interest to have a tragic twist twist before the whole thing goes to hell.. the film takes that point, manages to not lose your interest and takes the fright away from you but the worst possible thing it does is create a worst case scenario where you realize that it is more fun not to see the film. The film is in my opinion about as worth seeing as a snake's tail.. i wish it would just go away or be killed.. this film could have ended with a bang and we could have all moved on from watching it. The plot is incredibly dum	1	0
"Trawling through the Sci Fi weeklies section of the local television station (there was one in my area) I came across ""The Paradise Papers"" (hence the tagline) as a funny little program in the middle of the room to which I had been given a credit card to watch. Needless to say I've had to buy ""The Paradise Papers"" three times over in hopes that they may finally end up on the Sci Fi Filmnet but for the most part I was very disappointed.<br /><br />The plot of the show is actually quite good, although I haven't seen the original, Richard Linklater has written a script that makes for an enjoyable ride but this is set in a very different world from ours and while it makes for some funny bits you can't help but wonder why Richard Linklater's name is being attached to a film like this. I won't go into too much detail but in my opinion it's just a bunch of stuff we find in our own reality and is largely forgettable but I have to say that I do like what I see and that I would give this show a 10/10.<br /><br />I must say that one of the things that really annoyed me was how they put together the whole movie, and most of the clips I've seen were all included fo"	1	0
"I have to be 100% honest with you fellow IMDb users...this movie is so bad I'm going to just post the entire movie itself, even the comments and debates. I'd like to start with the positive points: The acting is very good, the story is interesting and (and I repeat I repeat this for the third time) it has a really powerful message. Now lets talk about the plot: Paulie is a dirty freak-looking boy from small town Texas, he wants nothing but pure pain, and he goes to an overzealous teacher, (speaking in Cantonese) who is brutally sexually assaulted by her son in the privacy of her classroom. Paulie is sent to a state prison and later escapes and meets up with ""Texas Charlie"", (an evil, lovable jerk played by the great Don Egan). Charlie and Paulie go on a journey to avenge their father's murder, but make an unusual discovery, their paths cross again when they meet a blind woman in town (Jennifer Sojourner) who looks like a cartoon of a girl in a snooty white dress. With the help of her blind guide (dressed as a knight and a fellow prisoner) they finally find Paulie in an old prison cell, and together they join forces to fight their evil friend...an"	1	0
For 50 years after world war 2 the United States had boasted one of the most advanced land based air forces in the world. Even during the Korean War the US Navy was one of the largest in the world. With the exception of the great carrier battle group, the majority of the air force consisted of Boeing 707-300 aircraft and one heavily used plane from Bell Boeing designed 747. While it has been suggested that the US Navy became more competent as a result of the T.X.E.(Test, Evaluation, Experiment) program, I find it more likely that the navy became more competent because the 747 was considered so expendable and it could be flown everywhere by either one of the two main air forces: the USAF or the Navy. And while I cannot necessarily say that the F-117 stealth fighter is the best ever, it certainly is one of the most modern aircraft of the era. The question that will always remain is if the F-117 can carry enough weapons to do its job. Yes, some F-117s have never been seen in flight, but as I have said in my previous comment, it is highly unlikely that any plane ever will have been able to carry a weapon like the F-117 itself. It would not be carried in a helicopter or even on a plane. Even the Soviet Unio	0	1
"Slash flicks come few and far between now a days, but lately there has been a lot of them. For me, I just saw Blockbuster close to the end and I was surprised. There was a lot of comedies for what they were worth. The one I saw at the end of my movie shelf was Man on Fire and with that title, I wasn't expecting too much of it. At one point in the movie I kept thinking ""How can this be as a big budget blockbuster as Blockbuster? In the TV show the last time I remember that I watched on TNT was while I was in kindergarten. All I remember was they were shooting on location."" Even though that was all I had, I still considered Blockbuster's offering good for what it was worth. What a great surprise.<br /><br />The story takes place in England during the First World War, a war that is seen at the same time as the border of France and Germany.

Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious plot revolves around the victim's love for the young woman that was his main influence upon his life. This same youth is also very much like the real person in this film. There's a scene in the end that shows just how much the torment and torment will bring, so feel free to laugh. And don't let those pesky teens scare you away; if you do, don't be disappointed. 	0	1
Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways.<br /><br />It was an excellent film in that it covered social, economic, family, spiritual, and religious issues on a very simple and meaningful level. It also had an eye on a very simple yet very specific set of concerns which led to a belief that those who lived in those particular historical times could discern what was going on in other parts of the world.<br /><br />In this, the setting was Belgrade. The city of Belgrade is a major factor in the story which is explored by Radek. Throughout the film he sits in his study with the spirits that accompany him and they give him a view of what he finds his life like.<br /><br />The cast, the makers and financiers, in this case Ronald Reagan, Jim Wynorski, Russell Haines, and Tony Rogers, just may have known what the script needed to go along with for a movie to be successful.

Before I comment on this movie I just watched on television something else by the same director. This was his first TV movie. If this is my first time watching something by Wuhrer he will be known as the true editor of TV series. The thing I like about this movie is the nudity. Even though it is obvious it is by human people. There are no cartoons showing realistic breasts and everything on TV was long before medical magazines. When I see about the age, the plays were made during the time of the Saved by the Bell film. I had thought that maybe they just should have said goodbye to those plays but this isn't so. While watching this movie I could feel the need to see more shows produced by TV companies like NBC and ABC and remember the numbers. 	0	1
Cinematography--Compared to 'The Wrestler,' a degree of verite and cinematic independence exists here. The film is often visual, most often at the level of visually evocative images. It plays with the metaphoric as well as the literal. It sometimes feels like a porno, the best example being the multiple'meetings' between Elvira and Natali (a scene which looked like it came straight out of the pages of an early Speakeasy book).<br /><br />The acting performances are uniformly excellent, with all but the most untalented average to good performances. Actually, as a German, none of the actors seemed to know their lines. Their accents were barely discernible; the only one that didn't falter was Nick Robinson, who seems overconfident and a little amateurish.<br /><br />The jokes--I'll admit, I was disappointed to not find any of the jokes in the movie completely funny. I understand how they could work, but the dialogue was so exaggerated and improbable that I was willing to suspend disbelief a little bit. In any case, the constant unnecessary stuff was way too much for me to digest.<br /><br />Add to the mix the slow pacing and the erratic flow of events, and you have a combination that cannot quite be described as realistic.

I can't believe others took such a serious view of this turkey of a film. A short film of just over 2 hours, this feature-length film is so dreadful in so many ways that it is simply impossible to sum up in one word. The entire thing is mind boggling, unbelievable, revolting, and utterly pathetic. This film is about as shocking as running naked through the woods with a lawn mower. To anyone with even a passing knowledge of life, I recommend avoiding this worthless piece of trash. It is so bad, it's not even funny. Save your money, pack a suitcase, and watch something else. 	1	0
Brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve.<br /><br />In this case, I think the film itself deserves a better review than that provided by the critics. There are a lot of films that would have made a lot of money, but because they do not have actors with adequate vocal talent, they become boring and dull. And if they do have adequate vocal talent, they don't really do it well.<br /><br />The problem, of course, is not that the cast is bad, it is that it is that the casting is lacking in originality. A remake of this film would have been an improvement. Let me explain.<br /><br />The story is already stale and predictable. Let's change that.<br /><br />First off, there is the large number of insignificant plot points that happen in the first 90 minutes, while it is quite obvious that this film is going to be shot over the course of the next 2 hours. In particular, every time a new character is introduced, the character gets a few lines of dialogue. We don't need to see that individual character get involved with another individual character to know that this is going to be a chase film.<br /><br />Second, the acting is horrible. It is very rare to find goo	1	0
"The first mystery is to guess what Welles' original film was supposed to be. It is not hard to guess. It is to guess why the script was done in such a way as to save time. This is one of the few films in which the whole is in the setting. In the screenplay the cinematography is a joke; but in the making of ""Demons"" Welles becomes more brilliant in making it his own.<br /><br />There is a stilted pacing of sorts. The special effects are in the right place and this is the sort of movies we don't see in museums but which people always seem to have on hand when trying to decide what to make of a war film. There are something like 300 plates of colour on display at the Baltimore and New York studios.<br /><br />The dialogue is the sort that was done to suit the time and place. Some cliches have been dropped as a matter of course. Why was Welles talking in a wooden pediment of a car? For no reason. There are a few shots of the military without uniforms; but we know that Welles only wore red trousers. His worst performance was ""Bourne Identity"", where he wears a white undershirt. One of the shots where his facial expression has been wiped by various chemical"	1	0
"Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the twentieth century, has made a film for the German market that is not too awful, but it is not particularly good. There is no content, there is no style, it's as if the director is too busy keeping his hands in pockets and worrying about how the camera moves on the screen. This film should not have attracted such attention in any way; it is an indication that the profession of film-making in the last decade had lost much of its originality to the present. The director should not be ashamed of himself for having made this. Certainly I never expected so much from a German film director.<br /><br />I have to say that ""Mask of Fear"" could have been set in Austria, but the only instance where there is a reason to do so is when the female villain is played by Barbara Lea; but in any case, it can go either way, no matter what the ethnic background of the actors. The theme of jealousy is not a very strong one. The main theme of the film is the girl's obsession with the boy; and she is quite faithful to him. That's the problem with a lot of German films from the 1920s. Some of them like ""Hallelujah!"", ""The Wolf Hunter"" or "	1	0
After Harry Reems' teenage girlfriend is raped by Zebbedy Colt (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her father (Paul Bartel), she works at her local ladies' club. Unfortunately, that place is turned into a sort of abortion clinic and Reems' girlfriend is left to deal with all the mutilation while being stalked by a vicious killer she left behind. When Reems is raped again by Zebbedy's father, he kills her. Then, he picks up the pauper hitchhiker by the name of Harvey. But, as Harvey gets in the wrong place by the wrong way, the suspense really picks up as they try to figure out how Harvey came to be in this place, and who was responsible for his awful fate.<br /><br />The opening of the movie sets up the story. Reems, Curtis and Paul Bartel are all in love. The plot has the hero having a brief affair with his hooker (Kay Pollak), and then, having to deal with this lingering desire, the hero would then have to deal with a woman who can't act the way he does. So, being a male writer and artist, Harvey could be either the one who gives Reems an abortion or the one who could have saved his life and saved her lover. You could watch the movie an	0	1

"This is a bad movie in the traditional sense, but it deserves much better. The story is interesting, but the script is very badly written, it's very weak and it's focused on having to do with (American) gangsters for the movie. The only good thing about it is the funky rhythm section that played a major role in the movie, but this didn't stop us from laughing out loud for several minutes. The acting was also weak, with most of the ""actors"" being stereotypical American whores. For a drug film, it was so bad it was humorous. If you want a slapstick comedy-like movie, this one is not it. If you want a good, slasher movie, skip this one. As for me, I fell asleep during a part when Jerry Kramer was on the phone. "	1	0
"I haven't seen the original ""Incredible Journey"" since I was 10 years old. I only saw it when I was 4 and I had never heard of it. I know most of the older people who know the film like it was their first sight of it. I was so disappointed by it. I hated it because it was a documentary about such a brilliant and complicated subject and it couldn't keep up with it in terms of what it wanted to be. The problem with the film, and as everyone else commented, the main problem with the film, is that it is not realistic. Like most documentaries, it is devoid of location footage and people don't live in detail because they don't want to. I can't understand why directors work so hard to show things that appear interesting. For example, when Annie learns about the camp in the news for one of the interview scenes, the camera should be rolling for the entire screen. There are many thousands of people living there in California but that doesn't mean that it would be filmed on a car and it still doesn't make sense. The problem with the film is that it never seems to get around to showing how Annie grows up and how her situation changes. It doesn't seem to show where she goes from there. When we do see Annie during her high school years it is important t"	1	0
Joe Don Baker is...Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a pudgy, sweaty murderous Mexican plantation owner who has been looking for the American slave who sold his wife for gold. His claim to be Jeff's son has been challenged by a lawyer (Joe Don's brother), and now that he is the center of the family's tangled web of blackmail, the odds are far against him. When young Jefferson gets thrown overboard by his crew on the infamous Grand River, Joe Don is unable to wrangle the boy, and instead hires the spirited Paulie (a deeply underused but strong Salma Hayek), the rebellious daughter of a Mexican family whom they sell as slaves. Now, young Paulie finds herself drawn into a truly violent, vengeful plot.<br /><br />Both songs about anger, revenge, and innocence played beautifully by the two main characters, Hayek and Baker. And it is probably the only scene in the film when the camera focuses on Hayek, even during the violent climax. Not a bad role. Salma Hayek is a truly amazing actress, and for better or worse, some of her best films are her best movies. Here, she plays as Jefferson a crazy, strong man who is actually quite dangerous to others. Baker is the sympathetic, kind Southern boy, only younger than Jefferson, who also finds himself drawn int	0	1

Unfortunately, he's after a priceless painting from the mountains and can't afford to hire anyone who doesn't work for a big American company. So instead of hiring an authentic French accent the local sheriff hires the stonemason played by Pou-Chi Chang.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT* <br /><br />You don't see too many movies where the acting of ""real"" actors is amazing.

*** THIS CONTAINS MANY, MANY SPOILERS, NOT THAT IT MATTERS, BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY BE UNAMUSED TO READ THIS ***<br /><br />The black version is by far the best and this is no exception. It's very accurate. For that reason, I give it a 10. Everyone else must feel let down because they feel it was a self indulgent attempt at portraying black culture. There's nothing wrong with that; why not try to make it more interesting, as many blacks do nowadays? I know that there is a lot of controversy about the different endings. Many say that the black and white versions can't be compared because the colorists decide how much black is used in the book. I say that maybe they used too much in this film but if that's the case then perhaps some form of another black or white film should be made for that end, too. 	0	1
Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson, and Binnie Barnes star as dysfunctional couples trying to find their way after a terrible murder. The film works fine, but is just not interesting. The acting is OK, and the script is strong. But it is too long, the story just isn't full, and the premise just isn't executed well. It may be just me, but it feels like all the moments that come after the initial murder scene are unnecessary. The daughter and her ex-husband argue on stage and the girl doesn't get to her true feelings for the man until the murder has come to an end.<br /><br />There is also a ghost lady who slowly reveals more and more of the family's secrets.<br /><br />Well worth watching for the horror, the romance, and the great music. 	1	0
Found this flick in a videostore, it cost $2 to rent.<br /><br />The movie is set in the United States and revolves around two research scientists in Tokyo. They take a trip to the Japanese Imperial Palace to check out all the artifacts and try to find out what makes the people live like this and why. However, when they arrive, they meet up with some disgruntled tourists who want to take over the site. However, the tourists are only interested in money, and want them to disappear so that all the artifacts are safe. And they want the Japanese Palace to dump all the artifacts for a tidy sum...<br /><br />The acting was OK. There was some good one-liners and some unintentional humor that works well. There are just too many funny, and tasteful jokes and I had to put in several warnings. <br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is that this movie had some of the cheapest parts in it. They have no sound, just very blurry images. I've always loved these low-budget/gritty independent Japanese movies, they make you think and you become just as entertained by what's going on as you would a live action movie. There was probably 2 or 3 really good scenes in the movie that still impress me to this day. <b	1	0
"With a cast of stalwart British character actors and pleasingly inventive dialogue, this was a pretty good film. We had a few tense scenes, but not much. Edward O'Connor and Margaret Hamilton are simply excellent in their roles. Let's hope that the other cast members don't get the itch to repeat their roles, because they'll do better. I wasn't sure whether George Kennedy had any lines to deliver, but that would probably be hard to come by. The gags were delightful, although for a film that prided itself on being funny, the way these three reacted to some of the gags was somewhat predictable. This made the film more enjoyable because we didn't have to play the ""actors"" constantly. Not only did it give us some laughs, but the gags served their purpose. "	0	1
"Hi, Everyone, If you saw ""Singing in the Rain,"" you should absolutely watch this film. The film was so amazing, I would go so far as to say that it really was the movie of the year, so it was an honor to have it made into a book. If you want to know why ""Romantic comedy"" has taken over the movie world, then read ""Romantic comedies: oldies from the past"" by Caroline Krastel. If you want a good laugh while watching this film, just read that and then just keep watching the film, because it'll keep you laughing for a LONG time. <br /><br />In addition to being great for all four of the main characters, this movie has great actors from all four of the main characters. I was shocked how talented those four were. The big bonus for ""Romantic comedy"" is that the two supporting actors (especially Jayne Meadows and Jeremy Northam) also acted very well in this film, even though it had to revolve around a dog. That's a really nice thing to see. I also must mention that I think that the scenes that were badly edited should be banned as they made it to the DVD. That being said, I only watched the first half of the film because it gave me a good laugh, but al"	0	1
Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they got stranded with no previous film to work on. So they went to the writers union, where they set up what was to become a classic project, The Visitor. <br /><br />The first month was tough. And the Producer had just gotten another one of his cameras and since the content was interesting and unknown enough that they didn't want to risk it to shot another one of his film... the video-on-demand business exploded. The story was original, and the cast was deep, and pretty much everybody played his or her part wonderfully. There were two issues that were raised on screen -- did they really go to the right place? And how realistic was it that those two famous hotel guests should be seeing a secluded mansion full of people in leotards just sitting in their rooms? They said no, the rooms were not secluded, they were set up as a convention hall. <br /><br />If it sounds like another obvious thing, it is. But to go through the minutes of the contract that was signed and see that this was considered a chance for everyone and for everyone's name to be on the movie is pretty shocking. Also, I wasn't even aware of the strike until after they had agreed to film the movie	0	1
A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into some sort of bug. It's up to the local cop, an actor named John Steinbeck, to solve the case and get him out of town. There's some nice atmospheric music (the sound of a snowstorm in the middle of the woods), some very atmospheric photography and it also has the occasional hilarity like watching this creature eat and try to eat the body of one of its victims. If you like a good zombie flick, definitely check this out. It's not the best out there, but if you love nice atmospheric music and a darn good zombie flick it's worth a look. 8 out of 10. 	0	1
"Considering all the teen films like ""the Breakfast Club"" and ""Thunderbirds"", I was still feeling the pull of ""The Dark Angel"". Unfortunately, ""The Dark Angel"" is the worst of the bad. It's full of bloody violence, disney-like over-acting and complete lack of suspense. Although this film is supposed to be a spy story, it takes place almost exclusively in an airport and with snitches. The plot involves a hired killer with the bad temper, the ultimate stalking tool - the time-pass machine, and a character who should be the epitome of evil. The movie is riddled with unbelievable situations that make no sense and are thrown together so badly that it just doesn't work. It's depressing and predictable and completely lacking in entertainment value. I'd be in danger of recommending this to my friends. "	1	0
"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people overlook how strange and random he can be. That's what made ""Airplane! And the Aliens"", which is (hopefully) his most famous project, so exciting to watch. However, for a few reasons I don't like.<br /><br />First of all, Verhoeven often creates two films simultaneously: one for screen and another for his video projects. In his second film, he added a lot of nudity and gore: the same things he had used in ""Airplane"" and ""The Terminator"". But in this one he went too far and added too many ridiculous characters (mostly annoying elderly women) and it's not all that funny.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though the sex scenes in the original Airplane are also very nice, the bizarre aspects of this movie are just a bit too much for me. There are more images that could have made a video enjoyable. For instance, one of the film's credits seems to play a very funny music video for the video game: he should have made the music track (of the music video in the original Airplane) in English: I mean, the music just makes me laugh a bit. And then I just couldn't see how Verhoeven could make the segment in which h"	1	0

From what critics and audiences indicated, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be viewed from the side of the father. It was an extremely difficult film to describe, even for an established viewer. The acting of Bela Lugosi and Celia Luque was first rate, and the often hilarious dialog was best of its kind ever recorded.

Zombie Review #3<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />Few films are actually better than ZOMBIE. This first off is to say that I actually enjoyed the film. The movie follows the story of a British mother and her five children on their escape from a zombie infested slum. Not only is the realism mind blowingly impressive, but it also completely ignores the audience's expectations. Why bother seeing this film if you already know the story? Again, no need to explain. It is a fantastic flick and delivers on all levels. Zombi 3 is what you would expect from the zombies first appearance. They are mindless, lazy and utterly brutal. The acting is superb too. Rosemary Harris as the main character is perfect for her role and everyone else is fantastic. Director Ian Livingstone, a veteran zombie fanatic, not only shows the final showdown between the zombies and the human. But the most spectacular scene of the film is when all of the zombies and humans disappear and start singing a sad, haunting song. Just because zombies can't act doesn't mean you can't appreciate a great horror film. This is Zombi 3. A MUST SEE. 	0	1
How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her; she's one of the best actors in the world, and she delivered a wonderful performance in this movie. The supporting cast was great, even though they had no lines to speak. The story-line was moving, and the pacing was awesome. This is one fine movie. If you're looking for a subtle erotic romance with Gwyneth Paltrow, look elsewhere, because you're going to be very disappointed. Everyone should rent this one, it's a must-see. 	0	1
"Now, many would think to stay away from this movie as far as quality is concerned, but for me I am one of those people who have almost always seen it before. I went to see it in its original splatter version on Video-X a while back, and after all the other gore movies out there I was hoping for something more typical, but after watching it again recently I found it more fun than anything I have seen yet. However, I should add that, I did laugh at parts of the movie, which I don't think will make the total viewing experience funny. <br /><br />While this movie was pretty good I just couldn't quite figure out what was going on. The music was catchy and interesting for what it was and how it was repeated, the zombie sequences seemed over-the-top, but actually, all I could think of at the time was ""The trailer just says 'go see this movie!'. Actually, it says more than the actual movie. See it!"" And I was right, this movie is not something to go out of your way to see. This is not a horror movie. This is not a zombie movie. This is a steaming pile of farting guts. This movie is BILL CUTLER HEAVILY INSPIRED WITH COCKT"	1	0
This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) that is only available on cable. It's from the first season (or something like that) so it's probably a bit slow, but it was good for the special features and I just can't figure out why it's labeled as 'Lesson/Commentary'. The adults in the movie must have lost money when they paid for it (the money for being paid to appear in the movie I believe) and so now they spend it on their school sports. It's not really any of the movies big flaws (like the worst'sitcom' ever made, or the worst bad comic strip ever created, or the worst people who could ever try acting in an episode). The plot is thin and the acting, to my surprise at least, is good. The actors themselves, along with the director, seem to be likable. They don't seem that bad and they are clearly enjoying themselves in some way. I give it a 7/10. 	0	1
"Comedy Central has had success with original programming using professional actors such as Jerry Stiller, Mary J. Blige, and especially Christopher Reeve. But ""On The Town"" had the greatest cast of any show that I have ever seen. Not only was the production extremely funny, it was imaginative and unpredictable. You can tell this show was meant to be held together by talent.<br /><br />Even though the show does feature a college student in it, I was most impressed by the comedic actor. He was quite an unknown to me at the time, but he proved he had the talent to portray the daily routine of the town. Not only did his delivery throw me for a loop, he was just perfect.<br /><br />Even though this show is based in a fictional town called On The Town, the success of this show also stems from the way it was made. We are familiar with the famous Two Alarm Clock, but here is a fictional story from a college student and his friends.<br /><br />By the time the opening credits roll, it is clear that this was a high school production. The sets were innovative and the dialogue was well written. I also noticed that this show was filmed in 2 days, but they had a significant budget for casting. This show seems to have bee"	0	1
Perhaps I'm out of date or just don't know what I'm talking about, but I don't think The Big Bad Swim is any sort of impressive film. It isn't for everyone, but for the bohemian camp type it's a unique way to get to know two great Australian rockstars. Sure it's a giant bore and out of time, but if you think rock music can't get any worse I don't think this is for you. For the rest of you who enjoyed The Surf (a 7.5/10) it's time to get real. Look at it as a 'fresh start' from two world class acts with some fantastic talents as good as their ability. 	0	1
"I had heard some not too good things about this movie before seeing it, and I was completely wrong. The problems I had with this film were not that it wasn't well written, but that the script was too complex and too ridiculous. There was the ""heckler in a 'Matrix' costume"" guy, who looks like he should be driving a Mack truck with nails stuck into it. There was the ""heckler in a 'Matrix' costume"" wannabe guy (yeah, that's right, the same guy from the original, and look at how bad he is now)who got caught by his friends with a bow and arrow through his chest. And there was the ""heckler in a 'Matrix' costume"" main guy who was killed, in one shot (which I also found out was incorrect), in one scene, and in one much, much scene, by one of the bad guys. How the hell does that happen? It just so happens that the characters on screen are from a whole lot of different movies, so the character from ""Porky's"" into ""Disappearance"" just happens to pop up on screen. Just what the hell was this movie trying to accomplish? In short, I give it a 10 out of ten. 2/10. "	1	0
"No wonder that the historian Ian Kershaw, author of the excellent PBS documentary about the anti-war movement, Lend-Lease: Israel, Hitler, and the Holocaust, has agreed to speak at the International Film Festival in Brussels on Tuesday, April 9. I can only recommend that you do likewise. Kershaw's new book is entitled 'Israel, Hitler, and the Holocaust'. That must be one of the great misquotes ever. Some time ago, in the Mideast Film Festival held in Israel, I heard a young American director named Joseph H. Stackpole declare that ""The hero of Auschwitz is himself the greatest victim of the Holocaust."" Maybe Stackpole means that the hero of the American anti-war movement is himself the greatest victim of the Holocaust. The truth, of course, is that the American anti-war movement has a rather unhappy history. (See the other entries in this series.) The anti-war movement has a rich tapestry of dead American heros. It includes John Lennon, Paul Revere, Joseph Stalin, John Wayne, George Washington, L. Ron Hubbard, Martin Luther King, Jr., Audie Murphy, John Lennon, John Lennon and a host of others. Even former presidents have been depicted in part as having been anti-war martyrs. There are some genuine heroe"	0	1
"This was the second of two filmed ""Hamlets"" in the series (""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""The Tempest"") and the first time George C. Scott was as creepy as he was in this role. This one had the benefit of using a script he had already written for ""The Spirit"" (""Scorpion's Playground""). While it might be better written than that film (which had been originally written by Martin Amis), this was still a good production. The ""actors"" were wonderfully cast, and the sets, costumes, and sets were all very elaborate. Unfortunately, ""The Tempest"" suffers from its somewhat predictable plot and the forgettable performances by Scott and Gary Cooper. The people in the cast were uniformly excellent; especially Brent Spiner as Jeremy Young, that of a nasty murderer whose violent rages are so understated as to be charming. As a sequence, the sequence with the swimming pool and the castle were particularly memorable, though perhaps not as memorable as with the dinner scene. Director Thomas Lennon did a very good job with the black-and-white cinematography, and the actors were well-cast. Scott is probably best remembered as the annoying father of Patrick Bateman in ""The Prisoner of Zenda."" Richard Melton has a much smaller role than usual in this film. The plot wa"	1	0
Which do you think the average person would know more/less about Martian wildlife if they had to read the book? The facehuggers from the movie? The supposed Martian touch? Or the discovery of a planet with water? All I know is that I just can't believe this film was so cheaply made (they really do put what looks like wire in the suits). The actors weren't bad. Paul Le Blanc was also very good as the possessed kid. But the whole gory opening sequence was awfully awful, and the movie's final bit is really bad. I kept waiting for one of the weird, mutated elements in the monster's legs to fall off (maybe one's sole leg could be a hand, or something?), but no such luck. Just completely pointless and just plain not a bad horror flick. 	1	0
"I sat down to watch ""Midnight Cowboy"" thinking it would be interesting and highly entertaining. I was wrong. It was just as bad as most of the other movies I watched the first night. They had a bad script, bad acting, bad writing. The set-up was horrible. The way Johnny goes through some kind of withdrawal after spending his money to support his wife and daughter seemed completely unbelievable. They should have called it an extended flashback. That would have made the film a lot more believable. Johnny was a child of God, he was not having any of the troubles that normal children go through. I hated that its director Mark Helprin thought he could ruin this movie with an extended scene. I just wanted to yell at him that his violence was completely irrelevant to the characters, the plot or even the story. I also feel sorry for the producer because he made a movie that I felt was more promising than ""Midnight Cowboy"". This is just bad writing and acting. We are supposed to be entertained by horror movies, I think I'll give it a shot, but it was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. This is one that should never be shown on any television set, not even on cable. "	1	0
A concept with potential, and it was fun to see what Edgar Rice Burroughs was able to come up with. The story idea behind the movie is very interesting but of course we are aware that the technology is far more advanced than what is depicted in the story. There are some stand-outs in this movie that I must admit were great but the problem with this movie is its theme of fairies. Just like the story does say, fairies are human and can and do harm.<br /><br />The movie is very hard to watch for the first half hour but then you get used to its basic themes and find it very engaging. The fantasy scenes were interesting and I must say, the special effects were entertaining and cool too.<br /><br />The movie is a mix between fairy tales, action, human nature and romance, all mixed together in a beautiful and very enjoyable story. It has a light touch and has some very innovative sequences in it.<br /><br />I gave this movie a two-notch because I could get enough of the characters in the story to enjoy and not have to feel bored. It also looks nice in its box. 8/10 	0	1
"The original movie ( dated 19??)did not show any ""monster"" but basically just some simple young person who gets run over by a car. After getting in the car, he crashes and he keeps on walking. The original movie did not show any scene of people getting run over and also did not show a coma or physical torture. I thought this movie was supposed to be awesome but it wasn't and has just become a boring movie. ""Nightmares"" had the best fighting scene in a lot of horror movies ever and the story was quite good. I am quite pleased to see this movie finally getting made. It is entertaining and good at times. This is one of those films you should give a try. "	0	1
No rubbish - no where even near rubbish. Not an educational flick - no good way to learn about my foreign country. The story was boring, not made with any creativity. The actors are poor and the fighting scenes were bad. This movie is even made in a way that makes it look as cheap as possible and make a profit by selling it on the internet. Don't waste your time - there's no value in it. And avoid it like the plague. 	1	0
"Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, but unfortunately some parents like to say that it's one of the worst movies ever made, also it's one of the most annoying ones too. The movie was probably made by Jooris van de Graaf, who made ""The Aluminium Soldier"". Other people in this movie like this movie: Steve Winkelman and Esther Van der Velde. Spacecamp is a multi-level movie, it has the story, the plot is good but it's not all it's name, it has some very bad jokes in this movie. The movie is kinda slow as you don't find the funny parts until late in the movie, but the most important part of the movie is that you must pay attention to when does the audience of a kids movies laugh. I know that I will soon forget the funny parts of this movie and in a month it will be something like The Parent Trap. My 8 year old son loved Spacecamp and to me he's really mean now. I can't really recommend this movie, there is some things that I like in Spacecamp, but you have to look at all of them. There are some scenes that I don't like and some other scenes that I must add.

"This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know it wasn't too great. The problem is, it's not that great. Like the late J T Lee (This is Spinal Tap, I'm serious), it has some truth to it, but the rest of it is just a smokescreen for doing what the plot demands: having sex. If you've ever watched Naked Gun or Back to the Future, you know what happens. Cheech and Chong are both a lot sleazy, loud, and mean-spirited, and we see them ""revenge"" themselves at the end of the movie. What could happen is that the hero and heroine decide that they're just going to have a big party and smash up some van (for real this time), and then, the ending credits roll. The great thing about this movie is the possibility that it could be either a very clever plot, or it could be just another porno, all topped off with lots of ridiculous, gratuitous sex scenes. Probably the best I've seen is an old man letting a young woman put a big black cock in his mouth. It was one of my favorites when I was a kid. If I had to rate this movie on its own, it would be like a 2/10. Also, for some odd reason, thi"	1	0

The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side is satisfactory and good. The production values are good. The script is well written and the actors are good. Most of the actors are poor and in need of serious training. But they are still good.

"This ""tragicomedy"" written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic (yeah right - he's the person behind that strange sub-genre of absurd comedy) had an interesting structure - and in many ways it could be considered a comedy of manners. There's not many really well-known jokes in it, mostly due to its script, but some stand out (i.e. the dancing pianist). This film is generally watchable, even though the actors are not too good.

This film's kind of like Conan the Barabarian, but with rocks.<br /><br />The movie is really very simple, and yet interesting, because it has this peculiar story. When a creature like the Yeti attacks a village, you have to put it in a cave and light it, otherwise it wouldn't act, which means you have to get it up into the sky.<br /><br />While it's not too scary, you can't really say that the character's personalities are exaggerated. The story is actually not very good, but it's not exactly hard to understand it. And the CGI is pretty good.<br /><br />Although there are many locations, this is a very low budget movie.<br /><br />However, if you can understand a few basic mechanics and understand the story, it's worth watching, even though it's a rather bad one.<br /><br />It's got some nice good scenes though, like when the Yeti speaks to the villagers. Like I said, it's not really that bad.<br /><br />8/10 	0	1
Hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of Edward Scissorhands, you know what I'm talking about. Which, after all, is why I made it a regular feature of my television guide. As it turns out, I was a total turkey after about 6 of those movies.<br /><br />Of course, the problems seem even more glaring since they turn out to be somewhat similar to the ones presented in other stories. So, for the rest of us, maybe we can see the forest for the trees. It's a good movie, too. I don't get tired of this sort of thing. 	0	1
"It seems like this is the only film that John Waters directed at all. It's not an obvious choice. It's not even obvious to me that he did anything with it at all. It's no doubt he did some TV writing, but that's the only film he did on the Underground at any given time, so there's no personal development for him on this film.<br /><br />While it's not quite sure what Waters was doing with it, a few interesting tidbits emerge. The best one is the whole wasp story. (Nasty wasps don't need to be bloated in order to work. They can even be Tiny!) Although they're not anything I would want to take home myself, they're cute and somewhat hilarious.<br /><br />Another notable tidbit is the fact that the Jane Eyre audience comes in with a thick book, full of wayward observations. They find all sorts of ""gemstones"" on their walk back, which they use as clubsticks to light a cigarette. One is a small tattoo. The little girl gushes from it. It's so original that I actually laughed out loud a number of times.<br /><br />That last bit seems to be rather true. My book of observations ended up pointing to the rather luminous jewel o"	0	1
"When I first saw this movie I was with my sister who lives in California. I had never seen it and was very excited that she was able to see it because I had seen the introduction of the movie and she said it was going to be ""one of the best movies I had ever seen."" Well I did. <br /><br />It was hard to explain exactly why this movie was so great. I could tell just by watching that it was a story of a relationship gone wrong.<br /><br />I just did not care for the lead actors. Kurt Russell was at his most despicable in this movie. He would go on to fail miserably in two more movies. I can't tell you enough how awful this movie was. This movie made me laugh, I cried and couldn't even think of a good reason why I watched it. It is true, the acting was so bad that I thought it was going to be funny.<br /><br />I didn't know how to describe this movie, but I think it is the worst film I have ever seen. I love bad movies, but this movie is just horrible. Don't waste your time or money. "	1	0
"Actress Patty Duke wrote an insightful, funny, rough-hewn book about how Joan Crawford became the main character of this film. It's a small detail but an important one. There are some really funny things about this film: The famous scene when Crawford plays a Mexican drug trafficker to leave her daughter and with Crawford's grandmother (who is reading her daughter's ravings to some neighbors) takes place over one long margarita and in the typical Crawford way of saying ""Oh, you, you move fast."" Crawford was a real deal and the role of the temptress to the naive farmgirl should have been played by Patsy Duke. Instead, Duke's version is filled with charm and beauty. She is a great actress and she steals any scene she's in and then some.<br /><br />Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland are okay but the script seems to have the actors raring to go. Only Gregory Peck as an unknown vice officer to Crawford falls short of greatness. However, see this film if you enjoy early 50s Hollywood. It's a great comedy, with one of the great examples of how to use all the tricks of the trade that Hollywood was bringing to the screen at the time. "	0	1
"Susan Swift is an appealing youngster, a flower child transplanted from Rochester to Miami. She's off to an academic writing summer in New York City, where she finds an affluent New York hostess (Amanda Plummer) and then her dream life as a model, with long hair and the most enticing voice she can muster, both male and female. In between working this sort of glamorous task and driving her young daughter to public school, Swift is pregnant. But when the mother, a wealthy acquaintance of hers, is killed in a car accident, they move in with a lonely man named Stanley Riedel, whom she meets when she returns from a drinking binge with photos of him on his wall. Riedel has never forgiven Swift for letting him kill her father and believes that she is a liar because she lost the baby. He also considers Swift a bitch who has nothing to offer the man who killed his father. He knows about her pregnancy and a desperate psychic she met while she was a teenager. He refers to Swift as the ""good woman of her type""--a woman who can do anything to please him. And this is another case in which Swift plays a tough woman, although she is no gentle giant.

This was a great movie but it had the worst acting job ever put to film. The director (Michael Bozz's son) failed to remember to take his jaw off the handle. <br /><br />The movie had no reason to be in a foreign language with one of the accents being Turkish and at a store called George's Way. If you read the manual before buying this movie or even buying the tape, then take a copy and read it. It is a waste of time.<br /><br />I am in my late 30s.

"Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her estranged husband Frank to take her to New York for the funeral. She asks Frank to pick out a special performer to play her piper. He writes in his notebook that he'll do his best, and that it'll be the one singer he loves at the time. Frank picks down Andy, and goes off to Florida.<br /><br />Frank isn't ""doing his best,"" he's doing it with a lead singer whose career depends on that of Bancroft. He wrote in his journal that he thinks his performance is good, even though it's nothing like his own. He tries hard to match his own voice, and that's what really bothers him. She tries to mimic his singing voice, but the two aren't singing to the same person. In fact, the whole movie is about the tension between the lead singer and his supporting player. She makes him fall in love with her, but he seems to love her and wants to marry her, and so on and so forth. One of the problems is that the film seems to go on forever, because for some reason everyone keeps looking at Bancroft, not caring about what she's saying. It seems to be just a great sequence that sets up the rest of the film.<b"	0	1
Corny! I love it! Corny - just as the TV series aired on BBC2. The film was just... well, it was worse than the TV series. It needed a lot more time in the director's chair to find his style and to pick his characters, and it wasn't all that believable in terms of how the stories developed. It didn't help that there were few believable characters and they didn't always seem to get along well. Not to mention the main character(s) weren't terribly likable. The direction in the film was pretty bad, and some of the scenes were so badly done - it makes me wonder if we were supposed to accept things like this as part of the make-up and lighting.<br /><br />However, there were so many more 'corny' moments in the film. The graphic performances, for instance, were the highlight. I knew this was going to be a television film and it's usually nice to see actors (especially the supporting ones) coming off better than this, but that can't be all right, can it?

Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. They compare it to The Cat in the Hat, but that's an obvious comparison since the characters are so different and the film just does not feel the same. What this movie does does is try to make a point about bias in the system which is complicated by the way it seems you can control the actions of others and expect yourself to do the right thing when all the system wants you to do is get them on their back. At times I wondered if the whole thing was a huge character study for Dr. Seuss, except for the fact that the satire is taken right out of his own book. Brown might have made an interesting movie, I just don't see why this movie got made. 4/10 	1	0
"OK. I admit. I'm one of those nerds who have always disliked horror films. The fact that it's made with (allegedly) the funds of the popular sci-fi channel, USA, and (allegedly) it has a writer of the F-word at the helm, casts my disdainful eye. Not even Schumacher-based Evil Dead can induce nostalgia for me. Not even Blade Runner-based Alien Syndrome. Even for the seriously young-a-holics, Psycho's sappy and deliberately kinky swill just doesn't get my blood pumping. No, it's neither campy nor obscure. It's campy because its disturbing for so many reasons, and it's obscure because none of its producers seem to know what they're doing. I was bored during half of the running time, and though there's still plenty of opportunity to flex your ""special effects"" muscles, be prepared for more contact than the mainstream cinema would allow.<br /><br />The credits start rolling with a chittering introduction that would have fit the cover of a New York Times magazine.

"A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era. Obviously, they relied heavily on ""affluenza"" and ""the outside world"" as themes, but for the most part, the shots and pace are only slightly less worrying than those in Orson Welles' ""Masters of Horror"" and Hitchcock's ""Psycho""--two films that already have more credibility than this odd homage to violence and glamor.<br /><br />The plot is just about the most of the usual Scooby Gang plot, with the usual'spook' candidate (Larraine Bracco, our lead--a stereotypical housewife who believes she's the reincarnation of Cinderella), her typical extrovert, and the usual suspects.<br /><br />Of course, there's also a ""smart aleck"" that's more or less kicked out the door from the others, who's a newspaper reporter in search of a scoop on the witch's ""death curse.""

The sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies saw many sexploitation movies. These usually focused on the exploitation of the female sex and were rated R. Other than these 'R' rated movies, there were few R rated movies. A few sexploitation movies existed that got away with a PG rating (like Vanishing Point and Strip Club Bloodlust). These sexploitation movies were made by Sabu Productions, a production company that I have always disliked. Sabu was an earlier production company that was still doing sexploitation movies under the Sabu banner, namely Sun Boys and Strip Club Bloodlust. One of Sabu's earlier movies (in the years of De Palma and Pulp Fiction) was Die Hard 2, which I have seen countless times on the video store. The plot is a fairly decent one. A bunch of karate savages want to make it big in the sexploitation business. Their first victim is the cool and sexy Vegas cowboy Miss D, who is married to a mean Mexican. If you get a chance to see this movie, do. Just make sure you watch it on its original VHS format, not the long running TV series DVD.

This movie is very good. The screenplay is enchanting. But it lacks style and sense. The characters are like tiny animals. The whole movie feels trite. The director tries to make us think so much, it doesn't work. He creates a rich world. A world which makes us feel that everyone is guilty and everything is happening for nothing. That the experience is temporary. No regrets. No happiness. No satisfaction. It's just boring. There is no joy. This is a false paradise. Actually, the world is far from this. In fact, the only pleasure I felt was from the magic. Beautiful nature of animals in the forest. Redwood trees grow near me. The master of the place is not human like me. He seems so peaceful. His spiritual power so very much draws my soul. I like it. 	1	0

"""Dracula II:Ascension"" is the story of a group of medical students trapped on an island in the middle of the desert. They are put into isolation, where they are forced to fight to survive. John Holmes, the leader of the group, wants to travel to the other side of the world to get revenge on Dracula for his first murder. James Stewart plays the snooty Dr. Tremayne, who wants to destroy Dracula. He finally realizes that they are all insane, and, in order to bring Dracula back, he must bring the rest of the students and the entire island to reality. For the last time Dracula will never live again. If it wasn't for Stewart's brilliant performance, this would be a bad movie. Sadly, this film isn't bad at all. The acting, the directing and most of the special effects are all excellent. A bit violent, but the ending is a plus. "	0	1
Eytan Fox, whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of the christian agenda, has on occasion gone to some lengths to take a controversial stance, such as in Haunting the Good Earth, when he made it clear that he thought that abuse of animals was an abomination. His track record of documentaries as such would suggest that this doesn't happen too often. His methods for presenting documentaries don't always tell the whole story, and some viewers will probably have a strong reaction to a film which paints the messenger's point of view in a light-handed manner. Haunting the Good Earth isn't a movie, nor is it an objective documentary. It's an adaptation of some religious texts, one of which I am not familiar with. While Eytan Fox does attempt to take a more open stance towards Christianity in the film, I would argue that the strength of the anti-christ and the unity of the church has had much more impact on people. From Christian fundamentalism to the eastern seceding, modern human oppression of the underprivileged and so on, humanity is made to understand the idea of sin and believe that we are destined to hell if we continue to commit it. Even people in the village that reject Christianity have spoken of it as a word that was used by Jesus that kicked them out of paradise, which ca	0	1
"The first ten minutes of ""Just Looking"" really dictates the plot - Pauline (Tashan Brown) is a popular author in town who is drawn to the house she's recently purchased. With the help of her amazing father and her neurotic neighbor, she is able to capture the attention of Jimmy (Bruce Willis).<br /><br />The entire plot isn't bad... except for the ending. While you can see how Kevin Kline's character could be in a lot of scary movies right now, I don't want to see him in this. I hope that Willis doesn't get any of these films... if he does, I'll be disappointed.<br /><br />7/10 "	0	1
"A genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s. Famous Jimmy Stewart (as the bloodthirsty Mike Epps) is followed around the gas station by the needy and old (""Oops, I forget about you!"") Dave Coulier (as the dour Old Nick) and a belligerent Joan Fontaine (as one of the dumb ""crackers""). As Mike sings ""Where was I?"" at the end, this DVD is intended to be just that. "	1	0

"I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed so hard i nearly fell off the couch. I'm not going to say much because I'm not sure if its one of my better films. I'm just giving it a try and I really don't like it. There's so many cliché's you want to get your teeth into. Carrey's performance was too stiff at times and not funny at all. I am definitely considering not watching this again. I even was one of those people who thought SLEEPING WITH THE ELDERS was a good movie. Maybe if I had seen the previews I could have predicted it being a poor film but honestly this film just didn't have a good feel to it.<br /><br />Even though there were a few ""Chewie jokes"" in the film, I wasn't in the mood to laugh. Thats a shame because the joke was so sweet and moving. If the joke wasn't good enough, there's even a few subtle ones.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big fan of Carrey. In fact I don't think he should be seen as a comedian at all. But that doesn't mean this film was OK. I thought the entire film could have been better. In fact the worst thin"	1	0
"While it contains facts that are not widely reported, it does manage to capture the reality of the situation the parents were in. The behavior that the parents had and are experiencing is not typical. All I can say is that it's good to know that not all of the stories out there are as believable as what was depicted. As another reviewer says, the parents did something just like anyone else would have done. Not only that, but there is no evidence of anyone going to a party or celebrating with anybody that was not at that point in the life of the child. Most of what was depicted is why a lawyer would try to file a lawsuit. There is nothing traumatic about what these parents did, and the fact that they acted out their emotions against their children's wishes does not create a ""feelgood"" movie. "	0	1
I must say that during my childhood I'm quite proud of Oliver Hardy's great works. He was a true artist. The fact that these like movies are being made nowadays is a shame, because we have many great artists out there and their work should be looked for. My Grandfather was a Graphic Designer at Sterling Cooper, so this movie can only be seen by those who knew Sterling Cooper very well. It could have been a book if I wanted to go back to that, but at least I remembered it. I am trying to find a copy of this film, because I remember when I was about 4 years old and my uncle brought me the tape. When my Dad showed me the tape, I was about 10 years old. So it really should have been played when I was a child. Maybe someday I can see it. 	0	1
Reviewed at the Sept 12, 2006 2nd screening at the Thunderbirds Legion Field in Lakeland, FL. It was the only time I saw the movie. I also enjoyed the fact that the sea creatures and action were pretty much something you'd see in a lot of other Sci-Fi movies, mainly military films with massive blasters and jet packs. I've seen most of them.<br /><br />Well, I am sad to say that I had to take it to a commercial cinema in Tacoma, WA. The worst one I have ever seen. I have seen all kinds of Sci-Fi flicks. So that last one was the worst. However, all I had to do was do a 30 second commercial.<br /><br />Seems like there is no more to say.<br /><br />I would recommend people to check out the movie, even if it was one of the worst I've seen. This movie is worth checking out. If you're a Sci-Fi Fan, watch it. 	1	0
"I turn on 700 Club once in awhile and only watch episodes which don't turn out to be all that bad. (The 2005 documentary: Biggest Loser gave me a taste of what I was getting myself into). This show has it all. The so-called acting is great, plus the directing is above the average for most shows on the network. Don't watch if you're too dumb to notice and are really struggling with the plot. The background music is a great fit with the daytime programs, and the acting and writing is good. But, the editing is appalling. For example, the contestant who starts off her night by looking like a clown wins all three rounds. How is that not ""odd""? Doesn't look like she's acting in her sleep, which the other contestants obviously notice. The way the news is edited makes the overall mood of the show almost seem as if it's trying to be dark drama. If you are watching this at home with a heavy-handed TV-adaptation filter, you are getting the movie (or is it a series?) that is just about'making you feel bad for losing.' The episodes made me look into the TV just to have a laugh. They've got literally every bad actor in the industry. I mean, come on, would you watch a Gary "	0	1
There is one detail, which is not very common for action thrillers; in the last 30 minutes, we get the last half hour or so of the film. Let's just say, with it the style of farce and drag on the sides, and a few bits of plot that we hardly understand or care about, we actually ended up laughing. But if you want to laugh at how sick this film is, you can check out the poster. I'll bet it. 	1	0
Alright, this film is the representation of several things. For those who love terrible movies, it's one of the best. It's full of scarily beautiful women, frighteningly effective zombie/invasion/white heat plot (which you'll get no problem with) and good acting. It's kinda similar to Night of the Living Dead as well as the original sequel (which if anyone knows any more about it than me, let me know. Don't ask).<br /><br />If there's a problem, it's that the film really doesn't have anything to recommend it. The plot in itself is pure crap: The daughter of the President (Laura Prepon) is murdered, the government is involved and zombies can kill people when they think they're inside a building, the killer returns after 30 years, the government is hunting him, you're about to be eaten, the zombies will get you and the President will get some measure of revenge.<br /><br />I mean, it has one redeeming quality, not to mention the fact that when the script writer read the book, they went with the idea of putting the virus into people instead of killing them. Even if the director did it all just for laughs, he'd have to've been a creep at this stage to think that anyone would actually car	1	0
"When I first saw ""A Cry in the Dark"", I thought this film would be the last in the series. I was very wrong. Well, there's more to come. I thought the director was over the top and at times just plain offensive. The problem I have with his movie is the pacing. While his movie is certainly interesting in it's own right, it just takes WAY too long to get to all the fun and entertaining scenes. To me, it would have been more entertaining if he filmed it in the early eighties. I just thought that the story itself was disappointing to say the least, considering that this was made in 1986. There was nothing memorable about this movie, not the big name stars, not even the cute kids who play some of the leads. As a first timer who likes and adores this type of horror movies, I'd say this is just a more entertaining version of ""My Bloody Valentine"". But as for the film itself, it may be because the plot is more predictable and predictable it's a bit like watching a child's garden-variety movie. The characters were very forgettable. The musical numbers were stupid and pointless. If you like movies with a lot of violence and gore, watch ""Sudden Impact"" instead. "	1	0
"Vincent Cassel plays the part of Paul, an ex-con assigned to escort Chris through the Gold Coast. While not as bad as I would have liked, there was one major disappointment. The plot is weak. The acting is weak. The direction is weak. The music and special effects are weak. (Seriously, give me a break.) What has made this so really watchable is Cassel's hammy delivery of lines and his ability to mentally put together a half-baked, flimsy storyline. Simply put, he is one of the most likable people in the movie. Cassel was not always a flawless actor. That said, it is interesting to note how far Paul has come over the years, and his acting shines through his personality and great gifts. Although there is no ""Bible Code"", all of the film's cast members clearly have something good to say, even at a professional level. There are some sad moments in the film, most notably in the credits, but the overall message of forgiveness and reconciliation is one of the most touching and powerful things you can see in a film. The ending is very surprising. (***) "	1	0
"This movie had potential and I was willing to give it another chance. In an attempt to break the mold of ""redneck revolutionaries"" who just want to hunt and kill (it was good to see one actually kill on screen), the acting was good, the plot got you more than halfway through and there were a couple good fights. While the movie didn't really fit anywhere into this category, it still had a good flow and the scenes (not only the final) were interesting.<br /><br />The movie is about a group of federal employees and soldiers who decide to attack a Wal-Mart in Georgia and try to arrest a Wal-Mart gunman who they believe is responsible for a similar attack in Atlanta.<br /><br />While it doesn't have the ""Kato buzzsaw"" of the other Kato movies (Kato states that he is able to ""shoot people in the face"" with his bare hands), the acting did get me interested in the fact that it was played by actors who were ""senior"". It's an honor to be in a film that even attempts to look like a real movie. If this movie wasn't made I would give it a 0 out of 10 but for good reason. There's a reason for that and this movie deserves an 8 out of 10.<b"	0	1

"most of the bad reviews on this website blame ""Hood of the Living Dead"" for the film's rather flat effect. I don't blame the movie. it's flat. I blame the acting. I blame the script. it's flat. This is a 4.5 out of 10, purely because you don't have to believe it's true. And if you do...wow. That's really hard to top. I mean really. John Barrowman is one of the better actors in cinema. I don't think I've ever seen him act that way before. Yet this film is him in zombie form. That said, you can see he does lose some control at some points, and I don't blame him. That was quite a transition for him in the film, to try out acting more of a little show. Well done, John. I'm not saying that the acting is all right. I'm sure it's about the best acting I've seen in a very long time, so for better or worse, it's still good. The horror/thriller part of the movie is kind of weak, even for this genre. Anyways, it's got some very good actors. Barrowman plays the lead role, and given the fact that this isn't the best film made, it'"	1	0
I don't think you can get much worse then this. An illiterate newspaper writer (Wendy Lander) works on a suicide pact and puts on a friend's talk show (Olivia Dothan, who should have known better). This is a great movie as it has a satirical edge with funny moments, like when Wendy goes out to take a shower and puts her shirt back on and she reveals that her brother had overdosed on acid. As the film is so absurd you get sucked into the film; this is an example of how so many people watch all kinds of trash to find a chuckle. My guess is that if it had been shown during Saturday Night Live a lot, the number of people involved might have stayed away from it (which would have been great)<br /><br />I like the fact that Wendy and Andrew try to help the struggling couple, since they are close and it just seems like they need a break.<br /><br />3/10 	0	1
The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that portion of Castro's rule that was over the border to Cuba. It is the period during which Castro was very popular because of the revolutionary character and this is where he played the role of Che. At the end, he goes back to his own palace and loses all his support from his former supporters and the population of Cuba. His niece gets mad and tries to assassinate him, but Che jumps in front of a train in time, and winds up with nothing. The second part, A Judas, is about the first Christmas in 1936 in Cuba, which is Castro's birthday. Here, Che is involved in an assassination attempt by an old couple, the women's families. Castro gives Che the Order of Martyrs and orders that Che and a bunch of revolutionaries who are at the same time brothers with the couple get off with a slap on the wrist. The third part, First Blood Part II, is about Castro's speech at the Communist party convention in Miami and it basically revokes the constitution. Everyone that was with Castro in Florida (like the local Florida sheriff, the local lawyer, and the Florida deputy sheriff) are declared traitors and dead, and Castro has them executed. Castro also takes control of the mining company, which gives him massive control over the profits. However	0	1
"I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand the other night and there was a lot of hype on this movie. I can tell you the absolute truth. The rating is 2 out of 10. I'm not sure if it's because of the media hype, the negative reviews the movie was receiving and people calling it a sequel or just some horrible little movie that almost didn't exist. So I'll just give you the easy answer...<br /><br />The 1st reason why I hated this movie is that it is so bad. This movie is not funny, stupid or anything. It is painfully obvious that they knew how to make a bad movie before even setting out to make a good one. This movie sucks so bad that there is almost no laughing out loud when a part of it occurs.

The Blob is a classic 1950s B-movie sci-fi flick. You know those killer cobwebs that start moving and never stop? They were created by a virus and they want people to start dying. When the Blob attacks a town, it creates a biological weapon and the same goes for the townspeople. Watch out for a virus called 'The Third Man' that acts like the blob's deadly alien virus. Now that is a virus we can feel real fear for! The only good thing about The Blob is the special effects, but that's about it. The movie is boring and action-less, except for the highlight for me was the split screen shots from different perspectives of the action, and the fact that this flick had such an entertaining plot and story line. I actually have a copy of this movie in my hard drive, so if I ever needed an extra VCR, I'd never have to buy a new one. It's a classic sci-fi flick, but a classic that's worth watching several times. 	1	0

One of the things that bothered me about this film (as I do with most of Marshall Charles's films) is that it seemed to be saying, in effect, ""Do as I say, not as I do."" While I've had little problem with Charles making b-movies in which he provides some of the gore and violence that is necessary, it was a bit hard for me to like this film at all.

"When two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of Frankenstein it has to be in the English language. This ""Beowulf and the Eye"" is in English. The writer, Matthew Kitagawa, got the idea from his own horror film, the little brother of ""The Haunting"", where we see a monster eating people. All the historical characteristics are there and matched well with the plot. However, the whole movie starts to lose its ability to make you be scared at certain points.<br /><br />The story is about the conflict that the hunters (Rogers, Gough)have with one another as they try to save the sister who has lost her brother. The first part of the movie introduces us to ""Jack the Lady"", who seems to be a mannequin turned into a human. It is therefore surprising to see him as a man after the time they spent in his mask. As it turns out, the lady died with her husband. When the hunters find out about it they question the mannequin's presence. In fact, he was not the only one who saw the dying husband.

"The person who wrote the review ""enough with the sweating.Leave me alone"" for this film has been nothing but negative. The sets were not interesting. The camera angles were not unusual. The plot was not interesting. The acting was not interesting. The film-making was not interesting. I suppose it would have been a hit if not for the fact that this film was directed so poorly it could have been worse. The love scene between the female lead and the main character, in fact the entire affair of the main character and the main character's daughter, is the highlight of this film. The cast-minus-worthy actors make this film of interest. Let us hope this film's commercial success is a sign of things to come for future directors of films about minorities and their relationships.

Let this film serve as the death knell to the soul searching genre of American films. It's not my favorite film, but it certainly is one of the most intellectually challenging. Not to mention the fact that it was made with so little money that it's a lot like playing in a one lane street without taking the other lane--you know that in your bones by now.<br /><br />This film can be described as dark, cynical, and disturbing. It is a horror movie that mixes 50s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with today's remakes of Aliens and Deep Blue Sea, combining all three ideas into one engaging and memorable experience.<br /><br />But the most interesting thing about this movie is not that it's cool. It's that it is. While James Earl Jones' character is a bit bored out of his mind, he is likable, earnest, and decent. The performance is strong and convincing, just what you want from a James Earl Jones role. Two other performers do a good job of expressing the creaky relationships of the characters. The story is drawn out and well thought out. The acting is occasionally appalling, but it is meant to be a horror film and could have gone either way if the director wasn't so talented.<br /><br />Once you've see	0	1
Disney, the film name that once stood for all things Disney has returned in the form of a Canadian film company. This is a surprise coming as our country's film industry is one of the best in the world. However, this doesn't mean that it's a great film as it's at times slow moving and rather not engaging and sometimes because of the production values (like some sequences which seem to have been edited out to make way for a horror film). All in all, the film falls short because of the low production values, but I am willing to give it credit for trying and this is my only reservation of the film.<br /><br />Everyone thinks they know what a Disney film is, or at least knows what they should expect from it. Well, I'm a very humble guy so I can't say I will enjoy every single Disney film, but in my experience, some are very good and some are simply terrible. One of my favourites is based on a stage play by Merle Oberon which is the only reason I gave it a 5 instead of a 1. The story is simple and would not have been easy to film or produce - the stage play is based on a real story and if all of it was put together, it could have been quite brilliant and beautifully realized.

Probable reasons why so many people on this site have voted so highly on this film: 1) The length of the film; 2) A score of 6; 3) A plot of potential 80s melodrama; 4) The fact that in the year 2007 this film was made, MTV only featured adult films, such as Ice Age and The Legend of Zelda; 5) This film was produced by Peter Jackson, and used footage and animation from The Lord of the Rings. To wrap this lengthy review up, I'll just say that I'm quite sure that whatever little redemption this film has that I witnessed is entirely dependent on the passing of time. My Grade: F 	0	1
In the opening scenes of this movie a man shot by zombies turns into a cat-like zombie. And that's it, just like the movie. This has nothing to do with the actual movie, but it has to do with the fact that the film and the opening scenes are about a vampire man turned into a dog. Then one day he can't stop killing people and realizes he has to kill again to become a normal human again. After that the movie only goes a little bit downhill. Eventually the right people get involved, and the whole film becomes a lot better. Unfortunately it does not last. Throughout the movie we see more and more zombies, only less likeable ones, and the two lead characters are killed pretty quickly. When they were killed it didn't make much of a difference because there are so many more of them that won't kill anyone. But the humans and the vampire find that out around the second half of the movie, when some of the zombies are killed, but not all of them (more on that later). After that the film starts to get much better, and it almost makes it to the end of the movie. Then again, at the end of the film the evil scientists put their hands into the dog's head, which was the original ending of the movie. If you can wait fo	1	0
"Very sweet pilot. The show reeks of Tim Burton's better days.<br /><br />The actual story is about a group of writers trying to write a book for themselves. It seems to go around the whole world on the internet in real time. It's a good idea that all the world reads is expressed through your own soul and thoughts. However, we end up not knowing exactly what we want to say because it's all pure sentiment. To make things worse, the (admittedly phony) poets are not only being beaten to death, but they also have a crush on Henry who has the ability to teleport in between bodies and kill people. Not one iota of substance is given to the point of being funny or poignant. My basic impression is that this show could have been a very funny sitcom back in the day, but that doesn't make it good. It is interesting to see how much of it has been transferred over to The OC, but overall I found this to be a fairly flat, predictable show.<br /><br />My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Sparta Esclaves"" (""Souls in Time"") "	1	0

Reportedy based on actual historical events, this disturbingly violent, bloody, weird horror comedy movie is for the very young and very old. The reason being that the Japanese were more powerful than the American soldiers, who were not much better at fighting than the Japanese, they were more like the Indians or the Huns.<br /><br />My expectations were high from the start. However, after viewing this movie I'm quite disappointed. The story about Americans and Japanese coming to America to fight, and getting massacred while doing it, is pretty much an over-the-top, clichéd tale of Americans and Japanese in WWII. So what does it all have to do with Nazis and Japanese ruling the world?<br /><br />To begin with, I didn't expect much of it, the plot sounds kinda boring, and the action is totally unrealistic, no tanks, no big tanks, and nothing like the classic shots of tanks coming up from behind, showing soldiers next to white guys (I thought that was supposed to show them as the enemy, but it also made them so much more realistic, I'll save that for another review). After this I started hoping for a final solution, some sort of battle between the Americans and the Germans, or maybe a political rally, and then something cool happened. There was none of that	1	0
"This movie is goofy as hell! I think it was once billed as an action film, but it's just a puny little comedy about a bunch of characters who haven't been given a chance to go anywhere in their lives. They're all basically emasculated wannabe action stars, desperate to prove themselves and to prove how tough they can be. After playing ""pickpocketing"" for most of their lives, they finally decide to try out for the big time! It's funny to watch them do it, like a couple of campers they go to prep for camp. They all start to flirt with each other and make out, but they try too hard to make it seem like the point of the movie was to show how silly they all are. After a while, the actors lose interest and the film just kind of rests there, completely unmoved and nameless. I tried to call it a short (which it doesn't) because there's no explanation of what the purpose of the movie is really. The only thing I did know is that they do it for the money, that they're just going to get rich and break up after getting out of this clunker. "	1	0
Well, I don't think the picture is as bad as some reviewers claim. The film is very obviously the most expensive film I have ever seen, not that that's bad. The acting and cinematography is quite good. The movie has some very impressive special effects, and all in all, a reasonably interesting picture that just has some silly errors in it. It has some rather outrageous gore effects and some fairly graphic rape scenes, but those aren't enough to really ruin the film, and they certainly don't ruin the film for people that like to see movies with a few disgusting parts.<br /><br />Honestly, this film could have been a little better if only there wasn't that incredibly hard-to-find stretch film with some rape scenes I couldn't resist buying. If the other reviewers saw this film, I would have made sure they were paying attention. The people who would be offended by the rape scenes in this film would do themselves a huge favor and walk away. They are clearly trying to shock the viewer. The people who would find it offensive are easily the most willing to see it. So the problem is that the extremely hard-to-find stretch film is the problem. 	0	1
It's really annoying when good movies like this one go under appreciated because they have not one but two really bad movies in it. Mr van Dien's 'This Side of Paradise' is well thought out and well acted. But it has a huge problem. I had no idea what is going on and i wanted to go see this movie from start to finish and i did not.<br /><br />After 'This Side of Paradise' i just didn't know what the future holds for this masterpiece of a director. Is he going to make another lost in the wilderness love story or is he going to remake any good movies from the 80s that are worth saving and showing on one big screen. I am still waiting for him to either remake all his movies or simply get off the work (maybe maybe some of the best looking slasher films of the 90s but I hope that in the future he'll actually get off his idiotic projects). Nothing will ever replace this hell-yeah masterwork from Mr van Dien, if it ever does I will wish I had never seen it. 	1	0
A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time starring Eddie Murphy. It's not even the original with the kind of humor or the acting that was so enjoyable in the original, but it is one of his best efforts. Also featuring Rosario Dawson, Kaley Cuoco, and Daryl Hannah.<br /><br />Acting is by far the worst part of this movie. At times the jokes are so bad it feels like there's a kid in the play. Then again, Eddie Murphy is in it all the time, so why would that be any different.<br /><br />Plot is somewhat decent. You know the plot and how everything goes down in the dark, and that's what this movie does with it. But most of the scenes are almost the same every single time. The good things is the humor and the acting. The bad is that the first half is more comedy than anything else. And as some of you might have noticed, the acting in this movie is nowhere near Eddie Murphy's. But that's what it is...<br /><br />But those are the two main points that I would like to touch on. And I'll keep the rest of the comments below that summary. The plot is good and the characters are likable enough. And that's it. Al	0	1
I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature on Cartoon Network and it was the first movie I ever saw that was more graphic than the classic rock 'n roll band. But the movie was not my favorite (The Evil Dead was) so I was a little disappointed by it. I suppose it made more sense to me now when I consider the material it contains. However I still prefer the movie's ending and the story behind it. So I am giving it a 1. I liked the catchy score, the original songs, the three children on the bus, and the dinosaurs in the film. 	1	0
I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still am lucky enough to have some of his plays in my collection) and he gave me a copy of this film because I was planning to buy it. He also gave me the opportunity to see this film in a free screening at the San Francisco Opera House when it finally came out on video. What a wonderful opportunity to see this splendid production for which Pal was famous. The entire cast made a superb first effort in this film, and only Debbie Reynolds retained her best performance. However, I was let down by a few overly dramatized scenes. For example, as Michael falls into the river, there is no flashback as would have been appropriate. I have been told that Carrie Fisher does not react very well to Michael's death. I was hoping she might very well have a change of heart after the scene where she takes a dump in a lover's room. Her character was changed from not believing the river existed to believing she was capable of saving him. Also, George Pal's other son, Andre (here by accident) was much too long in the tooth to have been shot in some of the scenes when Michael's wife has the tape recorder. It would have been nice to see more of Michael's death scene. I never understood why Nancy Allen was there when her husband ha	0	1
"""Why did they make them so big? Why didn't they make someone else make them big? <br /><br />I know their audiences, but I want to talk to the actors. What are you doing in this movie? What are you trying to get to? What are you trying to convey? Why did you have to make them so big? What do you want them to feel? What do you want them to see? Why are they so big? <br /><br />If there's a story, if it's the real story, and I tell you something you don't want to hear, what do you do? You stop talking about it? No, it's not a good story. If there's a story, you tell it in your own words, in your own funny way, in your own way that gives the audience something to feel, something to be scared of, something to be confused about. <br /><br />There are so many of those things. Don't forget that. I think that they should have just asked, ""Is this a story we should be interested in?"" ""Are we moving toward something?"" ""Can we get away from the problem?"" ""Can we make sense of it?"" ""Is there a good ending?"" <br /><br />The script ha"	1	0
"Skippy from ""Family Ties"" plays Eddie, a wussy 'metal' nerd who rents an apartment in a foreboding old building. As in ""Family Ties"", it's his miserable life and apparently you're supposed to care about him. When he tries to commit suicide, a mean girl calls on his good deed and beats him up, leaving him with a nasty gash on his face that heals within minutes. Why he hasn't met the girl yet, we don't know, but, you know what? Eddie has a lot of friends, and I think we all do, except for Chuck (Chris Kattan), an obsessed loudmouth who becomes an annoying private investigator.<br /><br />Eddie is unoriginal here. His apartment building is officially illegal and set to get a 5 year demolition permit. The current owner, a punk entitled ""Harvey"" (Derek Helfrich), is happy to see him move in. Harv comes across as a creepy and abusive mover-upper who works harder than he's playing cards and doesn't work too well with his brother, ""The Boogeyman."" When he notices that Eddie has lived there a few times, he tries to kill him. Harv scoops up the tape of the beating, and cuts open Eddie's face. She cleans the wound wit"	0	1
"This 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better title Story by Jane Austen, as these two separate stories were all that surrounded Jane in her early life. Jane's story isn't told in the film, but it's told by the slaves and their work. She lives in a time before women could vote, the Civil War was coming to a close, and her uncle Sidney probably couldn't buy their freedom in the free market as he wanted. But she has a ""sister"", Marlow, an English girl who is her very best friend. In the Civil War Marlow too is sold, leaving Jane her master's daughter; in this same context Sidney finally buys her. She is a good housewife and cooks for him and gives him advice on issues she had no part of when she lived with her father. But as Austen's character grows up to be her own person and self, she slowly comes to terms with her nature, love for her master and for others, and with the uncertainty of freedom. The two stories are totally separate, and tell a different story; in the former Austen can be quite spellbinding, but this film barely makes her look like any young person. When she tells Marlow she will never marry, it's a real relief for Austen to see her acting in her ow"	1	0
This movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered shooting progression of Indian soldiers in the West Fertile Crescent in the early 1950's. As the film begins with the 50th Indian Battalion (NIC) operating in South East Asia, you can see a lot of promise in the team members. Unfortunately, as the movie progresses and you begin to see them die in routine skirmishes with the superior Indian Company and the South Vietnamese Company, you become more and more uncomfortable. The moral ambiguity of both sides in the conflict become more and more apparent with each series of skirmishes until all that is left to contemplate is how much higher the outcome of this squabble could have been had it not been for the efficiency and heroism of the soldiers who took part in this expedition. All the more worrying when one considers the fact that the men actually qualified to fight on the field, yet as a rule their death was committed in doing so. <br /><br />As one is pushed to the edge of irrationalism by the film, one can say that the evidence presented to the jury is not well supported by the actual events. This makes the picture further susceptible to the slide we have shown with the events described in this movie. Had the film gone on to explain the early stages of the genocide, it would have been quite convincin	1	0
Antonioni's movies have aged not well. What always surprised me about Antonioni's career is that he can still make them so hard to hate, even by his own standards. The struggle to hold off the inevitable with such power is just too much of a challenge, and there are many times in Antichrist when it is difficult to watch the movie. You'll probably see reasons why there are people getting excited about it, but some reason I always find hard to understand. 	0	1
Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wrists with a straight blade. He slashes his wrists and it makes him bleed. After that he goes through a series of events which lead to his arrest and possible execution. What he goes through is a lot of disturbing and sad and unnerving scenes which make the viewer sick and angry for a while and before long after recovering from his shock and anger he becomes a complete psychopath who spews out his beliefs and leaves. The movie consists of gore-gasmic scenes, character's lost and found, and randomly happening murders in just the right place.<br /><br />This is one of those genre films which should be viewed in a very low light (movie quality only) only to allow it to somewhat develop it and the viewer understand how dangerous and violent it is. Some scenes in this movie are actually gory, the viewer may or may not be affected by this and if that is your thing then don't bother, if you are however I strongly recommend it, but not if you are a Wes Craven fan. 	0	1
The movie is okay, it has it's moments, the music is catchy and if you can get past the story it is not that bad. Some of the characters are good though, and if you want to see a cult classic who wouldn't want to see the rest of the cast all together to get naked and dance just don't waste your time. If you get into this movie then rent it for its beauty and youth. 	1	0
I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but unfortunately only saw the good quality ones and not the bad ones. The stories here are rather good, and yet I can say that they are not very original. This could be due to the fact that the character who plays Pang-hung is pretty unknown. I mean, what more could a boy ask for? Maybe someone should tell him that he should never go on too long of a trip. So, I was so disappointed when I watched this. The story was not very good, I'm not even saying that because it was not bad, because it just wasn't very good. If you don't mind waiting for a few good days, you could watch this one. If you like movies with Chinese actors, then I would recommend watching Bakshi. 	1	0
I could name plenty of funny movies. There are comedies that deserve my attention, and there are ones that just don't. Gannon shows the latter. It's tough to say why. At first, it seems like the movie's direction is correct. The two main characters are both full of charisma. Though they're an attractive couple, they both have some flaws and issues that plague them. They both like going out, and many guys are attracted to them. And with a few exceptions (most notably Caron and Senorin), the men are completists (and semi-feudal) peasants. However, when you take a closer look at these characters, you find that not all of their relationships are platonic. One couple is married to both men, but the man wants no money and the woman (or he is!) is happy with the situation, yet the man feels no reason to leave. She needs him to clear the debts she has with him, but the only way to do that is to get a job. To get a job that is not what they have in mind is for them to really get together. That would create something of a double-bind in the relationship. If they both want money, but don't have any other place to live, then this would be perfect. One thin	0	1
A young scientist is trying to carry on his dead wife's experiments into the relationship with a deranged brother. And on top of all of this, he's hired to play an old mobster. So he teams up with the usual half-cocked, half-memorable bad guy.<br /><br />Don't expect any laughs, but there are some chuckles here and there. And when he's not screwing with your head, you will have a good time.<br /><br />The Michael Caine/Marvin MacMahon duo are hilarious as the brooding, conniving brothers. Not to mention a totally awesome cameo from Harvey Keitel as a raving homicidal maniac.<br /><br />Although you'd expect a hit, the unexpected twists here are not in the least bit predictable.<br /><br />4 out of 10 for me, who thought I'd seen every film by the legendary Ernest Borgnine. 	0	1
"Regardless of what personal opinion one may have of Walerian Holmberg as an actor, I would never want to see his next film; Thank You The Sun. It would be a shame. Not only is it the worst film I have ever seen; it is a complete waste of time. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, but when it was over, I felt frustrated. After wasting three hours of my life watching this one, I decided to watch I Am Legend. The ""unbiased"" reviews seemed to be more interested in the personal side of this film, and less so about the overall subject matter. Granted, this film did have some good moments, such as when Holmberg was supposed to be in a hospital when Jesus shows up to heal the sick. However, the director, and director alone should have the final say in this film's future. Every person should be allowed to have their opinion, but if the director feels that this film is meant for ""watchability,"" then the director should be banned from directing anything in the future. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Olga Kurylenko and her earlier films. However, this film is simply wrong, and should not be anywhere near anyone's home screen. "	1	0
I found this movie really funny because you have a guy named Leo who is an officer in the military and he's in the mission where a bunch of white men walk out of the black soldiers base. And it was like this group of men like that you have the guys who are like a paramilitary group who think they are white men from New Jersey, but they're from Missouri who think they're white men from Iowa. And there are the guys who are like the bad guys, who stick up for themselves, and all that. And I think it was the good guys that beat up the bad guys, cause they got some faith in each other. And because there are these white guys out there, and we see them marching through these towns all over like they're driving the army, the navy or whatever to do a job, and these guys in those uniforms and they are white, and they're not black. And they're just doing their job and showing up and helping to protect the town. And if you looked at the first half of the movie, I thought, this is where the movie really starts to get bad. And then the second half where Leo is sent out to save this white town and it seems like he gets some help from the local Native American. But then there are the entire white soldiers in this tow	1	0
"The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares about insects and tries to find a way to find and release the young girl he loves, Jill. He goes into a local electronics store and tries to buy a bug repellent and he finds the most perfect one for Jill. He also discovers that insects make love, which caused him to search on the internet for what insects love to do. However, after many months, Michael realizes that there is no way to find a way to release Jill without killing the bugs. So, he goes to the local large community college to finish his degree. At the university, many students find out about the experiment and soon decide to stop it. However, the school is too late because there are thousands of bugs inside the campus and the bugs that the college sends after Michael. In the end, Michael realizes that he must find a way to free the insects that he loves and he gives himself the name ""Bugs Bunny"". This movie is really a funny story of bad camera movements, bad bad sets, bad bad music, bad bad direction, bad bad script, bad bad acting, bad bad cinematography, bad bad humor, bad bad special effects, and bad bad writing. That's why I give this one a 10. "	0	1
"**SPOILERS** A bit ridicules made for TV movie has sexy reporter Kimberly Miles follow the news and those who have done (im a big fan of the format) and then discover that in front of her you have the hot reporter who has just reported a murder. We are only shown her car and the hypnotic blonde reporter who is concerned about her own safety. She offers her body for blackmail (she will tell you much more) and though never made clear when and where the woman, ""Vanessa,"" aka ""Kathleen,"" is. The police think she is a psychic and vice versa and are forced to dispatch it or else get hit with a lawsuit. Jennifer Hale was hot as the reporter. I can't believe they canned her after her promising performance and she gave one of her more on screen nude performances of the '80s. Story lines: Vanessa is in a semi-fantasy world of strange sounds, wonderful fantasy vehicles and creatures, races with beauties and other seductresses, and dreams of owning a home, its beautiful environs, its no-stale good health and wealth. She's just as obsessed with making sure she lives in an ideal world as she is with trying to stay alive. Producer John Corbett is the astute by any standards with writer/director Joe Litvak wh"	0	1
No, this hilariously horrible 70's made-for-TV horror clinker isn't about any mythical beast or demon. It's about a guy who goes to a retreat where the folks have been sending ghostly messengers to warn them of some sort of disaster. There's a weird creaking, and when he looks up, there's some weird guy-mountain creature (?) humping him with its hindquarters. Now, his wife & kids are out there watching, so he goes off to find a way to scare them.<br /><br />I think the least scary thing in the movie is when he starts ranting to everyone that they're nutters and that they're monsters...that they're only following him to get in his personal heaven. Then it turns out he's actually trying to warn a real pyreneur or something, and is just destroying stuff. Not sure if that's supposed to be shocking or not. Just an awesome episode of 60's Troma.<br /><br />1 out of 10 (not scary, not even funny) 	1	0

Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the biggest hacknage of recent film-making. 'The Man In The White Suit' is a thriller that can only be described as a combination of 30s crime and contemporary art. In the '30s it's an 'inside look at police corruption' - what else is there? In the past it's humour as well as drama. Now it's the latter.<br /><br />The film, as set up, revolves around a city in which a former police chief (James Belushi) is desperately trying to find his way forward. His daughter Lala (Kerry Washington) happens to be on a summer job in the city and soon invites him over for dinner. Belushi turns up in this and, knowing something about Lala, he soon becomes obsessed with the girl's private life, although of course they're not exactly friends. When they meet again at a festival where Lala works, she is confused and him depressed. Soon Lala is caught and Belushi is left holding a grudge. Lala will face up to that grudge because he has committed murder.<br /><br />When the film begins, Lala is sporting a bad dye job. After a while she decides to dye her hair too dark. However	1	0
First off, let me say that I am a great fan of Tarzan. I also think that he is the best of the jungle apes, so I can only assume that I'm in for a good time when it comes to watching this film. In my book, this film is not a masterpiece. While there are a few epic scenes of sheer terror, one comes when Tarzan sees an ape talking to himself in a tree and notices the outline of a huge hand in the air. Apparently, apes can't make such amazing hand movements, but here it is; perfectly straightening and extending a branch, grasping the branch with both hands, and pushing it aside without dropping it. It's the first of many examples of gorilla behavior that does not meet my standards.<br /><br />Second, let me just say that I had several mild and disturbing dreams that very much resembled the one Tarzan is experiencing in the film. For example, the dream Tarzan has where he experiences a terrible dream of getting stuck under a moving kangaroo and having the kangaroo pull him out. In that dream, he can only see his leg being dragged behind him, but he can still hear a figure struggling in the distance. Unfortunately, in real life, there is a difference between having nightmares and actually having gotten stuck under 	0	1

Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the forest?! Its called an 'accommodation' and as it's rather sparse the sets is enough to satisfy the very demanding of film-makers. This isn't for the faint-hearted. The 'idea' is not an outlandish one but rather an 'original idea', so when the director attempts to further exploit its premises (eg the concept of an 'accommodation', the idea of a land, the idea of the nosy 'old man', the idea of a tree, the idea of a tiger's tail) it is undeniably successful and unlike most other movies of this type they succeed because they take the concept to a new level. No gore or grotesque acting here, just some fascinating cinematography and a very competent screenplay.<br /><br />Zulu Tiger is one of the few Kino movies to feature one of the title character's alien relatives in it, there are also 'negative' relatives, some very interesting aliens and aliens and a 'camp' setting. The story follows a family on the run from the alien cult and it's up to the father and son to find them and take them back. In fact the whole movie is directed by the director's mother (Mireille Schmidt). Unfortunately the film has little to recommend i	1	0
"When I say "" Doctor Who "" you might conjure up visions of George Lucas' other TV series, but for this my version is superior. So are the others.<br /><br />It is well known that with the strike in the UK in December of 2008 as well as the Andalusian unrest it would be impossible for David Tennant to return for his final role.<br /><br />Just some of the movies numbers in his final story are: the pterodactyl revival, the Marauders, the decontamination of the monstrosity room and the rest.<br /><br />Now for the point that's obviously overlooked by many people. As a well as the biggest fan I still enjoy series such as Torchwood and Torchwood United, the closing credits sequence that's all we get.

"A few years ago I added a comment to the Ron Livingston reviews for this film, ""When I watch a film, I try to get out of it as quickly as possible."" I mean, I've seen 'Shaun of the Dead', 'The Haunting', 'The House of Wax' and even 'Cabin Fever'. But no, I got too caught up with my normal life and things just didn't make sense anymore. When I thought about it, a few things popped into my head, and I decided to take a look at this one. Well, let me start with the first impression. So this film was released in 1993, after Ron Livingston had written a review on the back of the DVD sleeve for 'Shaun of the Dead'. Yes, it is a silly ghost movie. The story is one of revenge for a murder committed by a man named 'Cannonball' (played by Ron Livingston). So when a bunch of guys start slaughtering people, which do you think will happen? The Chilling Mary story? The kind where a woman was attacked and strangled by a flying ball? The Ghost in the Machine story? The fanfic story? I don't know. All I knew was that if I didn't like the movie I'd lose it in an instant. So "	1	0
The name of Nick Stahl, the young cast and the direction remind me of the old '70s American melodramas. However, the mix of live action & animation is completely new and without a doubt is much better than any other such feature. The only thing that seems to be new here is that there are a lot more naked women than of the regular variety. Why nudity is present is beyond me; not to mention that even the shower scene is completely different from the other films.<br /><br />The female lead is an absolute bust. The only interesting thing she does is to walk on tables and lock arms with the chief. At other times she acts like a bad woodchuck, but they got plenty of woodchucks in this film.<br /><br />Well played Nick Stahl, it's a shame you have to star in this. 	0	1
"This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny. This movie should have been put in the library. It is so mean and nasty it is funny. In this movie the main character is called ""Mooch."" He has to clean the studio a lot, and this gets him into a bunch of fights with all the guys at his studio. The beginning is sweet and cute but then as the movie goes on it gets more and more mean and nasty. But I think a lot of these film buffs were so taken with the part of the main character that they don't realize how funny it is. I laughed so hard at some of the parts I found myself flipping out at some of the same things. The movie has comedy that could make straight man humor seem slapstick, but the part where they insult his name and his family and everything else, it just makes me so mad, and only made me mad because of the situations that they find themselves in.<br /><br />A perfect example of being able to take a well thought out plot and make it funny, and then...in a matter of minutes it is just so horrible.

"After Fatih Akins first work ""Im Juli"", which was fairly successful after 13 years, he did not made ""Im Juli in second attempt"". I believe that he did his best to save the movie. ""Im Juli in second attempt"" is more or less a family drama about a young man whom had lived at his home for 13 years. After a whole week he comes home unexpectedly and finds his wife has married another man. After many different suspects in the city, he and his wife settle on believing that the man is not the man that he seems. The real mystery is why this man is never in jail. After many promising leads, the movie comes down in third place and is probably the only one of Akins films that might have produced a laugh or two but for the one-liners.<br /><br />Akins starts off the movie by reading the first draft of a comedy called ""Suji-chan"", which was completely by accident when he was watching a picture. Suji-chan is about a group of kids who try to make a fortune in the stock market. In the movie, it is only the boys that seem to make money, but not the girls.

I saw this film at the Chicago Reeling film festival. It stars Pierce Brosnan and was just released in the US. I had never heard of it and was quite sceptical. What a shame. I then heard it was being released in the UK. I was even more sceptical. I searched all day long on the internet for this film and I finally came across it when flipping channels on O2. <br /><br />I thought that it was a great, great film but it disappointed me. I could only see this for the third time. I remember it quite vividly and I still have flashbacks to it. But that was it. The acting wasn't anything special. They all had the same lines and bore me to tears at least once. One girl I remember, a brilliant actress played by Gaby Hoffmann, seemed really out of place. But the scene in the canteen in the movie that made me cry the most, was she doing this rock and roll/pop/jazz thing where she was in the middle of the bar/club, me and all the other people were trying to get her to dance. She looked absolutely bewildered and only then understood what the music was all about. This scene was so hilarious. I saw that in every movie she starred in. But she was simply lookin	1	0
It's a rehash of many recent films only this one has dragons as its main characters. It's an odd story that was made into an even stranger one. It starts as a fantasy/sci-fi film that goes off in an odd new direction. The first 20 minutes or so are the standout and give us the 'cool' scenes the majority of the film but they quickly downhill from there. There's no development of the characters until the final 20 minutes with the character, Tarragon. Overall the film is about an old man and a young girl and the dragon Tarragon. The guy in charge of this film really wanted to use dragons and created many terrible puppets to show the world the effects of flying.<br /><br />With this film there's no one the films audience understands and the main character of the film changes. You'll see them to different parts of the film. They start with an intense scene with Tarragon chasing the kids around a cabin, then it's adult days where it's a guy and some girl. The scenes on the kids are of Tarragon running around the forest and beating the crap out of children. That's it for the first 20 minutes of the film. Everything really goes downhill from there until the end when they finally reveal the Dragon in some very silly scene	1	0
Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is without a doubt ***** perfect *****. There is no subtext to the film, which is all about shocking the viewer. The film consists of the lowest of the low, which is best kept up for this one. The mind-boggling problem of the ineptitude of government workers, police officers and military personnel, who thought they were searching for the damn creature and then discovered it was a cute rabbit, were such to fail. The looniest premise I ever heard, and I'm the kind of person who gets a kick out of depressing films. The director, Matthias Koch, seemed to know he had to shock us by causing us to sit and see the film for two hours. With no redeeming qualities to speak of, this is a waste of precious film-time. I would recommend watching the original horror film of the same name, because it is still quite good. But this one's a joke and it will serve you well, even if it takes you four hours to do so. A word of advice for the original film: The special effects were better in the original. Do not rent this film if you want to see it on a big screen. You'll just ruin the film for everyone.

"""La Furia del Hombre Lobo"" forms a completely stand-alone storyline that revolves around the slow and sad death of a couple of beauties. After initially being convinced that the couple would at least die in the drug-induced passion of their relationship, they do die, and the story plays out as the two girlfriends try to hang on. However, there's much that can go wrong for these horny girls and their boyfriends as they get themselves involved with a fantastic cast of figures. It is a shame this film lacks one of the most fascinating and violent sexploitation flicks ever made (this will be very much lamented by fans of modern Spanish cinema and independent films), because this film has the potential to be a real classic in Spanish cinema history. Despite this, it certainly wasn't up to the standards set by some of the other great Flemish and Italian exploitation pictures of the era, and could well be considered not to be very good at all, especially considering the movie may not have the greatest cast. Unfortunately, director Alejandro de la Calamai's main weakness in this film is the fact that it does not work as a dramatic film. Most of the story concerns the love affairs between a mother and daughter and other characters such as a warehouse owner, an old man with long gray hair, a street hustler and "	0	1

"I was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of ""Girlfight"". But seeing how great the original was, I was definitely prepared for a great movie.<br /><br />Like the original, the movie has a strong message and was probably set in a certain time in a certain place in the world, therefore I felt as if the movie would get into some time frame that would make sense.<br /><br />However, the problem with this movie is that it doesn't show. The movie focuses on Chloe's most important love and of course, that's about it. Most of the movie was about her and Clint's characters that come and go. That's why there isn't much in the way of ""action"", there aren't many battles or quite many situations.<br /><br />However, despite this, the movie is very entertaining and the acting was very good, especially in the scenes with the novel characters. And this was something that the movie lacked in other aspects. <br /><br />There were some things in the movie that were just so unreal, that I found it hard to believe that this was an action movie. You don't expect the background and the atmosphere of a war movie, but this isn't that hard either. It just didn't provide enough entertainment.<br /><br />Like "	1	0
"Well, here we have yet another role reversal movie. There are actors who look like they have been cast in one of many run-of-the-mill action movies from the past 50 or so years, and there are roles for them in ""National Treasure"" and ""Godzilla."" And the filmmakers here choose to bring the modern adventure genre in with a modern mystery.<br /><br />And just like ""National Treasure"" or ""Godzilla,"" it has a single, well-intentioned storyline to it. It may be an action movie, but that's really all there is to it. The protagonists are dedicated treasure hunters with good intentions and also plenty of secrets to try to solve. The story is less interesting because it seems all our primary hero's motives are to simply be a treasure hunter.<br /><br />The acting here is slightly below par, and there is a decent amount of useless dialogue. But there's still enough to keep one interested in what is happening, so that's enough to merit the 7.5/10 it got. If I were to watch the whole thing again, I would probably see how it works out over time, but for now I'll have to leave it at 7. For all of its flaws, though, I'm glad that some so-called contemporary action movies lik"	0	1
"On one level, this film can bring out the child in viewers (even if it is not much of a family film, for example), and it can also show how more than family is lost in the stories of these three characters. On the other hand, the age range in which the story plays out makes it hard to determine whether or not this is a film about any particular demographic or group of people. While it is very exciting and well directed, I found the film, in general, to lack any real meaning to it, and the development of the story is handled with poor linearity. For the viewer, this seems like a poor decision; for me it seemed like an attempt to use a great story to focus attention on over the top events that happen around it, without a very deep insight into who the main characters are. Also, the movie seemed to take a pretty big ""homage"" to many of the classic films of the time (particularly ""Dracula's Playhouse"" and ""The Invisible Ray,"" to name a few), and I wanted the film to have a little more substance to it. On the positive side, there are several real memorable moments in this film, and it's easy to see why it was chosen to be included in the Summer Movie Classics Festival. It's nice to see tha"	1	0
"PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made, unedited, late 1950's Sci-Fi TV series. In fact, it is the brainchild of multiple screenwriters. Think of it as a bunch of cons who want to make a movie out of their day's work. What better way to do this than by recruiting some of the worst actors in Hollywood. John Lithgow and Eugene Levy could make the worst movie ever made, with even worse effects and writing. However, this in no way undermines the positives of the film. There is an originality and freshness to PLAN B's plot that is unique, imaginative, and revelatory. There is also a lustrous cinematography that says ""I have the information that will propel me to another era of inspiration."" Peter Lorre has a new lease on life as a serious director. The cinematography, overall structure, and the editing is a revelation. The emotional construction of the film is solid and the compelling visuals are masterfully observed. I cannot begin to describe the poetic quality of the script. Mr. Lorre understands the message of the story in a bold, visual way. The cinematography is gorgeous and employs a striking style of cinematography. The actors are extraordinary and most impressively, Jane Fonda appears to be wearing loose fitting bathing suits. This effort is absolutely spectacula"	0	1
"After seeing the trailer for Evening, you will probably first start imagining things so much that you will start to believe that you are right on track. After all, we already know that Stephen King has no love for humanity and that his stories are all long and filled with heartache and horror. The Trailer also mentions that this is not his normal type of film. With so many references made in the trailer to other horror films, I began to think that this was just a normal, even boring indie film.<br /><br />The problem is, there's a lot going on here that should be interesting, suspenseful and disturbing. But there is nothing of these qualities in Evening. The movie is an insipid attempt at creating tension by jumping from scene to scene with an excessive and not effective soundtrack (which I will not discuss). Even King's famous quote that ""Beware the shambling ghost"" does not help much here. There are a lot of moments that seem to have been lifted from other horror films such as ""Cabin Fever"", ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".<br /><br />King's movies are all original and I don't think it's very realistic to ask him to make another one. His films may include some nice actors but I find i"	1	0
Bette Davis' cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling. She performs well as the girl with the bird. She's like a young Joan Fontaine and was one of my favourite actors (I thought she was really hot).The guy who plays the homosexual (he is the son of a suffragette) does an OK job as well and it's a shame he doesn't really shine as much as you might hope. The story is ridiculous, there's also a lot of the same old bulls**t about the family and people. The last 15 minutes are a real disappointment. Everyone else has been saying the cinematography is fantastic and that it's another great Western movie (which it is). 	1	0
"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in Woody Allen films, were not at their best in this one, but those roles are pretty much no problem if you can remember to practice with your feet. That's what they should be doing. The only real difference between this and the Woody Allen films they've been in is that this one is no longer quite so reminiscent of Allen's earlier films. Also, the entire picture appears to have been shot on a video, with long pans and flashback footage, as opposed to a less-precise computer-animated film such as The Airplane! Anyway, if you've always wanted to see what Gene Tierney could do, this is a good way to start.<br /><br />Rating: ** out of *****<br /><br />I don't know why most of you guys have already found this ""buddy cop"" movie so interesting.

A fascinating look at the relationship of a single father and daughter who share a home. In this case, the father is a loving husband, who does not want his wife to leave the house. The daughter is another single mother and yet, she is not a complete absent minded child. The fathers relationship as fathers is a constant topic of discussion with the daughter's father. His incessant interruptions and concerns get in the way of what is supposed to be a close relationship, and what ends up happening is a lot of conversations, back and forths, and more interruptions.<br /><br />Avoid this movie if you can. I feel that some actors did not meet the highest quality of their performance. One actress had no emotion when she opened her mouth and was unable to get into anything productive. I will not make the movie worse, but if you can, avoid it. This film is very emotional, as all children do. 	1	0
"Let me state first that I love Westerns & Civil War dramas (James Stewart, John Ford, John Wayne, etc. all hold my interest), but not this crap. ""Homecoming"" is a fine example of the genre I hate. There is no good or bad about this film, except for those who got a kick out of it (I think). For some reason people keep comparing this film to John Ford's ""Homefront"" which I don't think is a good idea.<br /><br />The plot: A group of soldiers have to go through a checkpoint (which is true)to get into their truck. When they're about to enter it's heavily guarded by a few body guards. One soldier gets shot and dies. Their guns fire through a hole in the truck windows & into a body guard. The wounded soldier is placed on a stretcher & is then rushed to a hospital for his recovery. There he remains, unconscious & mostly covered with his clothes, until an ambulance arrives. Meanwhile, the other soldiers are gathered around the body guard, getting ready to take him off to the morgue. The wounded soldier starts acting strangely & we never see any signs of a struggle or anything like that.

"1928 is in many ways a ""lost year"" in motion pictures history. While it's up for much more today, it's on good grounds. What's most amazing about it is just how bad it is. This American production was given some very basic redo, and just made it worse. Mostly we're treated to a terrible dialogue that could only be written by someone who spent 90 minutes writing it. And because it's an Australian production, they don't even use the soprano.<br /><br />The movie is also about a father and his three daughters. Little Kay (Maggie Sutherland) has really grown up with the movie. Her sisters came from an earlier generation, and are more traditional in outlook. Little Sara (Frances Graham) had a nice, go-getting innocence in the big city, and seems now to have fallen on hard times. And the youngest daughter, Catherine (Kara Hayward), has always had that restless mind of hers, but to no avail. Little Kay finds her own way in the world, and it seems the life is just a little too busy for her. That's why we're treated to another big conflict in the movie: a pack of dogs attack Catherine. Catherine (here referred to as Lisa) is saved from them only by the presence of a friendly do"	1	0
"Definitely spoilers in this review! I **adore** American Gothic and like Gothic fiction more than any other style; I find it many many good elements that you may not like; however, I must say that ""Seed"" is not my favorite film. <br /><br />One of the most underrated films from Germany in the 80's is ""Detin des Veux."" Some reviewers might ask why ""Detin des Veux"" doesn't win an Oscar for this film, and that may be correct. A few things about the film: it's very long, takes an excessively long time to get to certain parts of the film, and the acting is horrible.<br /><br />I have to say that ""Detin des Veux"" was my favorite German film in the last decade or so. I would most likely see this film in an Italian film class, which I have given it a try for the last week or so. I must admit that I started to understand a little more of this film while watching the first 30 minutes or so, and then the film started to get on my nerves. It's about a Mexican family who becomes overly obsessed with human beings, people they are not related to. What will happen to this family? And how do the relationships develop between these people?

I know that there are some purists out there who think all horror films are bad, and that we should only see them for their gore, but I think that movies can be pretty good too. I've seen good films with really interesting story lines, and the fact that there are some soapy emotional scenes may make the films interesting to some people, but for me the horror genre has always been about great scares and great scary atmosphere.<br /><br />Nervous? Check.<br /><br />It's a story of a simple family, the Keystone Kops. Many of the 'adult' scenes have some sort of political message, even including where their leader is now. I like the bit where Axel gets drunk and rides off into the sunset (he shoulda said something!). Oh and the fact that the family hasn't had any visitors in years, even as a birthday present. When would that make me feel homesick? When something like that happens? If the scene was from real life (ie. a TV show from the 40s), and I just happened to be there and saw it, I would probably be fairly disturbed.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this film is that it fails to develop its characters.

"An old family story told to two young girls by their babysitter (and her friend, who's really the future of the film...haha). In that connection, and because the movie's so random, it has that nice quiet slowness to it. They move in to a quaint old house for the first time and talk as though it were their own -for awhile. By the end of the movie, it was obvious that their house was just a couple of hours away.<br /><br />The basic story is that the older daughter, who lives with her parents, is having a flashback of her youth with an Old World queen. Her aunt gave her the book on the new world, and she realizes that she only sees it when she reads it. So, the oldest sister spends her time away at the library reading some of the pages. She is encouraged to do so by the older sister, who helps her through her time away.<br /><br />I won't get into the specifics of the book/night vision experience, but there is a rather somber moment when the older sister says to the younger one, ""you'll have to come with me."" and the younger girl replies, ""maybe you should take the book back to the library,"" because after all, ""they're reading i"	1	0
the one and only season has just aired here in eminently acceptable quality. it is on weekdays at 7:00am on fox. after one season of horrible writing, terrible acting and terrible writing the program did have some nice moments, even if the first two seasons were just two more horrendous episodes written by 'Taron Egerton' who is most definitely no longer involved with the show. no need to mention the fact that everyone is absolutely desperate to make the show, and after watching it myself I can say that at the very least the ones who are not desperate for ratings will find the show a tad painful to watch. but if you look at it objectively you know that it is a very good show. there isn't really much else to say about this program, no, and don't waste your time and money on it. keep the plastic toys and VHS tapes. 	1	0

There's only one thing I need to say about this movie -- think again. It's not even that bad. It's all very quirky, over-the-top, and bizarre, but it's just not very good. And you can tell that the people who wrote it were just ranting and raving and babbling about how great they were and how bad they would become if they ever tried to make a movie. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with people moaning about the things that they do in their free time, I do believe that anyone who takes a chance and invests their own money into something they just think is brilliant deserves to have all the hell that that person will get for wasting their time and money. That said, if you're a KISS devotee you will most likely like this movie because the acting is good, the dialogue is uninspired, the plot is just plain boring, and the only song they really sing is on that Dandy Warhol album. Hey, it's KISS. You can do whatever the hell you want. 	0	1
The question is, can a movie this entertaining really be held responsible for something this terrible? It's not like I've never seen something awful, but I still think there's a difference between seeing something I didn't see and feeling guilty about it afterwards. The other day I sat through a very cheesy movie called Springwood, which also featured the equally bad events at Columbine High School. While both movies were entertaining, I don't find it offensive to say that they were, in fact, pretty crappy. The fact that there is a small amount of budget to this movie that shouldn't have been spent in the first place doesn't mean that the audience should give up because it was so bad. I had the opportunity to rent Springwood after watching it on cable and when I looked it up online I realized that the same people who did it thought the same thing: as a bunch of whiny college kids we should be embarrassed for trying to make a movie like this. Why? Because, while we all love this premise of a high school shooting and ranting about how the school should be shut down, if you're just going to label it as 'Camp Terror' because it's supposed to be for students, then all that aspiring actors in college can't save the day...except maybe Lincoln Perot.

"I like Brad Pitt enormously. He is an actor with heart who knows how to make a great performance. But he has not made one yet. For his last film ""Forrest Gump"", he was given the obvious choice of playing the great Charlie Fineman, a terminally ill man, played by Dennis Hopper, who becomes fixated on the hope that one day he might walk again. His hope being that in the memory of the Great Charlie, at the end of the film when he wakes up, for the first and last time, he will be able to take stock of his life and the shortcomings of his role as the Great Charlie. And then Pitt disappoints him. For the first and only time in his career he plays Charlie as he did in ""The Mirror"" a couple of years earlier, in a less than stellar performance, but still a great one. The other roles he has played have been generally OK. But this? When Pitt first showed up in this, ""Forrest Gump"", he was a guy who thought he was an actor, that he had the ability to change and turn his life around. He did not make one of his best films yet.

When Tsui Hark experiments, nothing and no one can withstand his maniacal creativity. This is the story of his latest creation, a jet fuuress that can fire bullets that can freeze the planet. The poor girl who gave birth to him, Ma of the Haseberg Studio, is a weeping heap who barely keeps a smile on her face after the birth of her son and escapes from her strange hospital room into the air. Before Tsui can complete his ridiculous attempt to re-animate birds, Professor Box, a space scientist, shows up to save the day. Within the span of about one hour, Tsui creates his masterpiece. There is no question about what happened with this film. The first 5 minutes are pure cheesy cheese and even though it doesn't match up to other re-animators like Ghost in the Shell, it doesn't have the talent to keep a viewer at a steady pace. To build the emotion and tone of the film, Tsui brought on the likes of Takashi Miike, Akira Kurosawa, and countless other greats in the film. This is the kind of film that can help you unwind if you try hard enough. This is also the first real Japanese film that takes you places that you wouldn't expect in a general fiction film.

I remember this game. It was always sitting on the shelf somewhere on my video case. I got it from a friend of mine who bought it from a video store but I had never actually played it. It was my first visit to an old video game and to this day I still get a thrill out of seeing it. There are many games out there that were created by unknown programmers that just didn't work out and that is why people do what they do. The story, the graphics and the lore that is this game are all those things. This game is a recreation of Final Fantasy VII. It is visually stunning and also contains some great customizations. These additions made this game to much more. I would highly recommend Final Fantasy VII to anyone who enjoys video games and is looking for a visual feast.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />However, the graphics are a bit dated. And by that I mean, there isn't much quality of life. There are about five levels but they are not well designed and they are not filled with each new character. The changes are done on a par with Final Fantasy VII but some may think it is a step too far. All in all, it doesn't even manage to pass as a good Final Fantasy VII movie. 	1	0
"Without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating power of horror that is in the norm for this genre, ""The House That Dripped Blood"" (the 1971 version) might be considered a much better film for some people.

The pair comes to see Price to discuss some kind of experiment, which involves severing off the patient's finger. They proceed to strip him of his clothes, beat him, and inject the victim with the human blood of his supposed victim.

Three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives on booze and gangsterism. They each get their four hours of fame by murdering a rich person. They die in a parade, after being let down by their leader. They give the victims a little nugget of story to add some drama and excitement to the proceedings. These three die of alcohol poisoning (of course)! And what do they do after they get out of bed? Their lives are pretty much the same, except now they dress up in full body armor, which is more realistic than the first movie. Things look like a movie, although it may have been made with a budget of several thousand dollars. They were getting to the end. But if they keep doing this they may never get there. 	1	0

But will their difficult relationship become a burden on the housekeeper and on their father?<br /><br />And how will the two moms react when their daughter, Jessica (Vanessa Williams) suggests they stay with her grandparents for the weekend? In many ways, ""Haiku"" is a rather ordinary family film, with little redeeming qualities. The family at least is open-minded and fairly open-minded in wanting to open up to the youngsters.

"More wide-eyed, hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to the phrase ""funky well-toned women"". The film is so entertaining you can sit through it for hours. The songs that appear at the end are clearly written as little more than echo shots to a real song (the city topless scene being especially annoying) but those songs are funny, because they don't fit anywhere else in the film.

Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you realise how horrible it is to have some government funding and all the fun can begin. When the local officers arrive to find out that one of the girls has gone missing a series of events become clear. A number of incidents can be seen unfolding as everything becomes extremely clear with each passing moment. The townspeople are unaware that there are three girls up there and that they have escaped the authorities. It's not long before the girls realise that someone is after them and they are going to have to deal with the consequences of what they have done.<br /><br />To make matters even worse the possibility exists that one of the girls is a child molester and nobody wants that to happen. However the girls decided to keep a very low profile during this time and it is this combination that has led to the town's popularity. Frownland is also made up of such familiar stories as a forgotten archaeological site and an old lady in need of a nursing home.<br /><br />What this means is that the film's screen time is based entirely on the problems that the girls are facing and how much it could take to solve them. It's not really about the murders or the teenagers and that was the most disappointing aspect of this film. It did have some element	1	0
This has just been broadcast on BBC and I am totally baffled by this show. I am also very confused at the fact that some parts of it are also being aired on the BBC. How can a whole series of books be written about a nation and have a book based on it and a remake of The Fifth Elephant, another BBC television series which I've seen (not having watched The Fifth Elephant yet but having read the book first), be broadcast on the BBC? The I.R.S., who was very active in the media in the 70s, are obviously very unhappy with this and can be forgiven for asking them to check their files and see what sort of ratings they are getting. I can't understand why somebody would put up such a misleading piece of crap. If a part of your programme is not so good, can't they at least pick and choose? My head is spinning and I've got to turn this off now and I'll wait for it to go away! P.S. - sorry for the unkind words but I just can't get over the fact that I don't think you can take a train in this country without somebody trying to force you to pay, not any more than you can eat out of an ice-cream parlour without somebody touching you. 	1	0
The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up once again for the super-annoying super-comedy that left most of us cringing in disbelief. In this one, James Belafonte (well, most of us didn't) and William Powell play con men, deceitful duo who try to poison water supplies in California. When one of their villains unknowingly enters the supply line and begins to drink it, the brothers get on the line to the public health inspector to advise him to keep his mouth shut. In the movie, the public health inspector promptly enters the line and is flushed down the toilet by the evil bad guys. Nothing dramatic happens for the next 50 or so minutes, but one delightful element happens when Powell's wife starts eating raw fish at a posh seafood shack and the two con men who ran him out find themselves with the chomping, um, chomping. So what do they do? Apparate to London and start looking for different ways to poison some folks. It's as if they're out to rescue a lost cat. The half-hearted attempts at comedy are just too bad. Since both Powell and Belafonte work with a hit song at the beginning of each take, they get an occasional big boob shot or silly early character snicker, but i	1	0
Well, it's Robin Hood as 'geezer' all right... just as overblown as 'one of the best movies of all time.'I first saw 'Rob Roy' on TV back in the 80s and was enraptured by this 70s act of British film-making. While I could not foresee any genre shift in the 70s (eg 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Rawhide,' etc.), I could imagine this being a funny movie. First of all, and not a big surprise considering the lavish production, the standard for the film is still quite high. The cinematography was bold and good. I laughed at some of the joke lines, even if they weren't intended to be funny. I can't really remember exactly how many parts there were that were genuinely funny, but a good portion probably comprised of a few perfunctory chuckles, such as the above-mentioned part. Oh, and there are a lot of puns and a fair amount of acting - it's a tiny role, but it pays off. I'm not sure if the special effects and special effects were to be expected or not, but it's safe to say you won't be disappointed. The acting was the best part of the movie.

Personally I couldn't get into 'This is Not a Love Song'. My usual approach to these type of movies is to stand on the sidelines and 'write the script' until the end of the movie. I'm all for 'write the script' but I also have a huge box of script-tips I'd like to see written about 'This is not a love song'. Why bother if you can make it appear as if I'm nitpicking or being a hack? The more I watch movies the less I like them. But the fact is, they're not that bad. Sure they're not great, sure they're extremely tedious, but that's not why they're bad. It's the way the characters are written.<br /><br />Here's what we have with the people who write Love Songs. It's the same basic premise, two couples (the one very good, and the one very bad) come together and try to have some sort of happy ending. At the same time, some groups and friends of the cast are involved in the making of the movie. If that doesn't sound like a great situation, well, this isn't exactly a movie for you.<br /><br />At any rate, I don't know if all the people involved are professional actors.

"Reading web sites on Bette Davis one can find instances that glamorize this film. This is not so. While that is certainly true, her performance and it's impact on women in Hollywood is not what was portrayed in this film. It's the effect the film had on her. The intimacy and maturity she brings to her characters are both lacking in this film and are absent throughout most of the film. Davis was an amazing actress but in this film her presence is lost, and her portrayal of Betty White is one of the most unlikable characters in the history of film.<br /><br />Sadly, because of her lack of success and her inability to attract anything beyond the male audience, she was forced to steer clear of acting until her career took off and her movie ""A Matter of Life and Death"" was released. Davis showed a talent for great acting, but in a largely male-dominated industry, she didn't get an opportunity to showcase it. Since this film, however, she has given countless performances of the highest standard and has been in films of all kinds. The fact that she has now never made a movie in her career says something about her as an actress and/or as a human being.

"Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the mental competence of Roger Ebert. Ebert has made a career of rating movies on their merits, but he has also criticized very high quality independent films. ""Blair Witch Project"" was one of those movies, and I'll admit I was a bit disappointed when it came to my reviews of it. I really loved this film and wished it would just happen. After almost the entire film was over I had to stop the film, and its admittedly low ratings are a lot to fault. The story is quite interesting, and though the premise has been done many times already, it does come off more real than were usual.<br /><br />I was so excited to see Molly Ringwald in this film. She doesn't do much, and while she looks pretty, is not that good at acting, or acting in general. However, the supporting cast is pretty good, and my favorite character is the codpiece prodigy named Keaton, played by John Waters. Waters has been a popular director for the last few years, and ""Blair Witch Project"" is his most popular film so far. While there were a few weak points in the film, this was still an entertaining horror film. Just because it does not have many twists does not mean it is bad, as thi"	0	1
"I got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments about how bad this film is. It's not even that bad, it's worse than every other film I've seen in this list of 100 of the worst films ever made. There is nothing here that I've seen before. The fact that it seems more like a comedy than a horror film. It has nothing to offer.<br /><br />Don't see it. Watch the Bruce Campbell version of ""The Tingler"". It doesn't have the same weird and wonderful story. And it's not awful. See it for the brilliant and inventive title alone. And if you can find an IMDb rating for ""The Tingler"" that's better.<br /><br />Oh and don't even bother. "	1	0
"FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre which centers around the sexual abuse of an older woman (the author, Emma Carey) by a young man she only recently met. To make matters worse, this doesn't help either. One of the more interesting aspects of the film is how it parallels its source, THE BIG LEARNING, with its pursuit of older nuns (two good examples are Vivien Leigh and Clara Burke) who are then investigated for their ""uncleanliness"" while also being implored to ""see a doctor."" This is a silly thing for two reasons. First, Claire Bloom as the elderly woman who is supposedly so nasty she wants to kill herself is the only one in the film whom we actually care about. Second, she really is really, really nasty.<br /><br />The story involves several lascivious aspects, including a raunchy sex scene between a neighbor's cat and the other tenant (the alleged perpetrator, apparently) as well as several sexual liaisons and a sadistic encounter with a young student. The film's most interesting aspect is the relationship between the two sisters, though their romantic encounters are brief and sugary. A bit too long and boring to quote from the summary, but good to know.<br /><br />This film is easily on"	1	0
I really have to disagree with guy-yardley-rees who (should he have bothered to check the comments) says it is not the best...it's definitely the worst. The film starts out with some good acting and a slow build up to the climactic fight between the two brawlers in the middle. Sadly the pace picks up a bit towards the end as the film drops into the kinda mindless movie where you think you're getting the full 90 minutes. Not to say it's not a good movie though, rather it is a bad movie. The story is mostly pretty good, really you'd never expect the completely uninteresting idea from this movie to make it into a properly enjoyable movie. If you're a big female action movie fan check this one out if you don't mind watching a movie in a boring boring kinda slow 'n' uneventful fashion. I hope that they have enough money to cover the cost of making the movie or they don't have much faith in it being a success! 	1	0
Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the gang at SNL did occasionally crack me up, I still didn't find this show to be particularly funny. When I see it listed on the Sci-Fi channel, I'll check it out. As an aside, I was one of the three people in attendance at this Saturday night taping and will be glad to know that there are several funnier movies (with better actors) on the Sci-Fi channel. 	0	1
Like one of the previous commenters said, this had the potential to be much much much better. That's because of the three main leads who are extremely likable. Angela Bassett's character for example, is so naturally likable that you can almost place your own view of her in the person.<br /><br />However, there are too many plot holes and half-measures for me to write any longer on this one. Unless you're a huge fan of only-tobe-winkleman, you should probably just walk out of this movie. 	1	0
"I was just a bit young for this one, but as anyone who has ever seen a serious movie (apart from an hour or two, when it's just dumb cussing) knows, the writing is bad. But at least the acting is good! Caine was great, and Walters was utterly delightful in a movie about two middle-aged working-class white guys discovering their inner values and taking action to make it happen.<br /><br />The idea, of course, is ludicrous. The rest of the story is ""let's make a black comedy, break out of the ghetto, blah blah blah"", so it's not really that surprising it worked for me. But the way the film was written -- by entirely ignoring its basic premise -- makes you think it is, too.<br /><br />The things we learn of Columbo's character, through the first half of the movie, are pretty fascinating. We learn, for instance, that Columbo has a hidden sexual history with an NYPD detective. (That's being serious, as these are just side characters, and not quite as interesting as Caine's.) And when Columbo's partner (the lovely Amanda Tapping) runs away from him because he's scared of her, he scolds her for staying. This is sort of normal fo"	1	0
Here's a real weirdo for you. It starts out with the obligatory romance which is used to build up the worst story I have ever seen (I'll come up with something better in the next 90 minutes or so). Then it turns into a big cheese fest of a love story (not that I dislike romances - it is true they can be boring) that ends up being somewhat laughable (there's no sense in having a love story between a killer and a mere block of people, even though that sounds great, I don't get it, that would be maddening). Finally it ends with the only conceivable love story - no actually original or funny use of romance - just some hot chick and a group of guys doing missionary sex (this wasn't anything special - what I saw, the trailer showed something along the lines of a group of bored stoners - this is nothing at all). <br /><br />All in all a very boring bunch of movies (and this is without even considering all the cheesy stuff I have seen in other movies in the franchise) that were made to take money out of the original movie. These low budget cheapie trash are getting into the territory of a low budget movie (low budget trash is what makes the original movies so good). Then again - as I said before, these movie	1	0
I have no idea why this flick is getting such good ratings on IMDb. I don't see how it can be so highly acclaimed, what with it being absolutely formulaic and not quite worth the $3.99 it cost me. There is so much in this flick that is not believable. People walk around the desert living their lives at a comfortable pace and being bored while waiting for an alien thing to come and attack them. The monster is so poorly written and/or acted (and honestly, the whole thing just kind of came out of nowhere) that you would actually think it was some kind of waste of money that was squandered and produced without proper intent. The stock music of the film is worse than most urban dance tracks. No wonder there are so many dreary commercials running over the top of the track that feature a bunch of old school bop/camo folks. <br /><br />There are a couple funny moments in this film. I won't say too much since it is a kids film and all, but there is a scene when a bad guy tries to shoot a guy and uses a knife he keeps lying on the ground. When he is shot in the chest he looks shocked and then manages to put his hand in his pants pocket as he runs away (repetitiv	1	0
Dominick (Nicky) Luciano wears a 'Hulk' T-shirt and trudges off in pursuit of his almost certain death. When he runs into the police, his demise is merely a matter of seconds to an eleven-year-old boy (Andrew Thorne) who is carrying a large-gauge shotgun. The enraged Luciano unleashes a savage killing spree in which he kills four persons in quick succession and scores more at the crime scenes. He goes so far as to cut off the hands of a chicken thief and smear his own hands with paint, all the while dropping his pack of knives and butchering an entire cow. Afterwards, he tosses the bones of his victims into the Atlantic Ocean in a desperate attempt to return to his island whence he came from.<br /><br />The master-f***ing psychiatrist Dr. Val (Zac San Juan) believes Luciano is a manifestation of a recessive case of terminal brain cancer and sets out to get rid of him. Equally desperate, patient Ryan (Jay Hernandez) comes to the island of Dominick to take advantage of the opportunity to work for his sake. When he spots an elderly woman scrounging through the garbage, Ryan persuades her to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement so that he may make a killing off Dominick.

This animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) from Gerard Negrel and Louis Lassalle is not for everyone, but if you are going to see it you would be better off watching it in two parts: the first part would be like a story, the second part would be a flashback. Since this was a French animated feature the sequences of the flashback story are somewhat laughable and almost offensive to my french ears, but if you are trying to see it in your danish form watch it without subtitles, it's really that bad. The acting is all over the place but some of the lines and accents are pretty funny and they're not bad at all.<br /><br />Rent it in danish format at http://www.desmarkverket.de. 	1	0
"Yep, you read that right, kids. Michael Bay should've studied how NOT to make a movie. This film is just one of the many movies his ""Made in America"" sequel ""The Transformers"" released and I'm sure all of his other films are due for a ""redone"". This one, unfortunately, isn't one. Not even close. Not to mention that there's nothing redeeming about it at all. But I'm sure parents in high school have little or no time to waste sitting through crap like this. This film is so bad, it's not even funny. Wait...there's some good laughs in here but who cares? I mean, come on.

A teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide. Just imagine what people would think of if they found out that he was a teenager...<br /><br />The story goes that this student is really good at football and has made a career for himself. He works at a local high school and tries his best, but then one day he is driving home from work and commits suicide. <br /><br />The schools principal, Ann Traherne, who the school authorities supposedly love because she is a women, is now the school director. It is Ann who discovers that the boy who killed himself was actually the student's teacher, her mother's maid. Ann becomes concerned for the students, as she knows exactly what kind of teacher she had and does everything in her power to prevent further tragedies like this. <br /><br />What happens next is a bizarre and unbalanced combination of drama, fear, humor, murder and a brilliant portrayal of lawlessness. <br /><br />It does not make a lot of sense, but in some way it all comes together to form an exciting and highly entertaining film that is perfect for television.<br /><br />Ana Boetticher will always have a special place in my heart, and this film should serve as a perfect example of why	0	1
Ah, the spirit of '68. The streets of Paris were alive with sentimentality, and the music and passion of the city was like no other.

My mom's band played there years ago. She even bought the tickets for the show's performances, which are now sold out. 	0	1
The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. Thankfully, some filmmakers like Victor Mehs (We Are Governing Japan) and Paul Anderson (Kung Fu Panda) bring it to the big screen. The boy and his raccoon friend play the sport of volleyball, and after training in a real rink, their dad Michaeli (Steven Berkoff) and mom Monica (Martha Reeves) decide to bring them over to the home of businessman and tennis great Bill Robinson (Tom Tully). Eventually, Bill offers the boy the chance to play in a tournament and the two boys see potential in each other. The volleyball events are exciting and fun to watch, and Michaeli gives an engaging performance as a man who has both problems with money and skill and who believes that Michael can help him. A talented trio who take a little time to get going is a recipe for a particularly clunky and at times confusing film.<br /><br />One thing to note about this film is the excellent work by Bela Lugosi (Spidey). He plays the young boy who is around 10 years old and has played for 4 years. He looks so young that his facial features look like he has just had a tooth pulled.

Very much a film from the times -- extremely long (quite literally), this has the feel of a TV series. The bad acting -- the terrible script. The storyline is about as far removed from the dark times of the Great Depression as is possible. The over-reliance on art-house films -- period pieces, kids movies -- that goes on for far too long here.<br /><br />Mr. Plowright gives a wonderful performance in this as is, and some scenes are marvelous. The story is easy to follow, and will hold up in both time and film. The direction, photography, etc. are very good, but that really matters here; this is not a romp in post-punk film noir style. All in all, a nice, not terrible movie.<br /><br />7 out of 10 	0	1
"You all know the story of ""Hamlet"". I do. <br /><br />The story I am going to tell you is the very brief summary. When he was 10 years old, Hamlet lost his mother in a tragic accident. At that time, he was a reticent boy. He was timid and hesitant in social situations. His physical appearance was in no way shocking to anyone.<br /><br />His father, Othello, took him to see the old, well known opera house where he was to find his way to the top of the world. Hamlet realized he had to let this audition go so he could find his way to the upper reaches of all things. <br /><br />At age 11, Hamlet took his mother back to the opera house, fell in love with the young Abigail (Robin Dunne), and became a homosexual. The joy of that moment was so brief that it did not even register until after he became a famous and celebrated actor. <br /><br />At 18, he made a fortune. He went on to play Othello in ""The Tempest"", and then took some acting lessons from those very same teachers, who actually gave him several acting lessons. <br /><br />The names and titles do not tell the whole story of ho"	0	1
"Okay, so the plot is on shaky ground. Yeah, all that hoopla about the Red Planet is based on the bad guys not being able to get through the planet's defenses. And because the planet is not Red, but just has an orange color and the general look of it is like a runny cheese cheese from an Eeyore doll, all the extra yellow elements about it reminds me of that cheese. Of course, the plot holes are numerous. In one very obvious, you don't need explanation to the story, but the whole way it was shot, the cinematography seemed like it was taken on cue by some creative schmuck. How do we explain all that green gelling? (or gelling undercoat?) More importantly, what does it mean when a machine, a cube or sphere or something is made of only components from a whole bunch of different ""materials"" but one of them ""is"" green?

Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that Busby Berkeley worked with Sir Francis Ford Coppola. It was an amazing film, which achieved a cult status in the cinemas. However, this film is also not just a movie. It is the story of a real life historical figure, and although it takes place in a fictional setting, it still has an incredible emotional impact on audiences. Michael Redgrave (Busby Berkeley) is in the latter half of his life, a playwright whose best plays have all been completely abandoned. He is no longer able to show them to audiences and has been reduced to composing them himself. His mother (Linda Hamilton) encourages him to write a play, to which he agrees. Together with his brother Franklin (Jay Esposito) and a part from Albert Einstein (Lionel Barrymore), Busby borrows a performance of Shakespeare, to which he has completely forgotten. When his mother dies in a tragic plane crash, Busby finds a copy of the play in Einstein's house, and he finds that he is capable of writing the play. He goes on to write the play, which is based on Einstein's story. As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Busby may not be able to complete his work, but his spirit remains with his cast members, who includ	0	1
"Early, heavy, war-time propaganda short urging people to be careful with homemade explosives is what made the film so popular.

"Perhaps I would have liked this film more if I had stayed home for the first time. This is an extremely dark and violent film which is meant to be taken literally. The plot is extremely thin, and it drags on for far too long. The only real acting performance I can think of is Mary Stuart Masterson as Ruby - The Doll, but she doesn't seem particularly convincing as the mysterious freaky model. The supporting characters are fairly poor, but that's a little unusual for a thriller. I would have liked the film to have left me a little unsettled during the final 20 minutes, although I won't deny that it was pretty funny watching Marie Richards trying to keep her face in the front row as Christine Duval sat alone in the audience while everyone else ran to the toilets.<br /><br />The story itself may be weak. The film is extremely short, so you can expect it to become increasingly boring as it goes along. It has two great songs, one of which (by Lennon and Richards) is very reminiscent of the action scenes of ""Reversal of Fortune"". The other (by Goldsworthy) is extremely suspenseful and makes the film seem a lot more exciting than it really is. The ending is also completely unexpected, although by no means is it an unhappy one.<b"	1	0
"As I watched this movie I began to feel very angry towards everyone involved. The story is true, this was a very popular movie back in the 50's. Who all was involved? Many were not even aware of the movie's existence, some were only in the theater for the big show.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a movie you see many movies about on TV (most recently Hairspray), and again, it's a really, really bad movie. Fans of the 50's would be put off by this movie, and fans of horror would be put off by watching it. There are no ghosts, no zombies, nothing but plenty of action and spookiness. We see Laurel and Hardy getting chased by three female henchmen and a ""Prince"". Apparently this is the most popular thing ever filmed, but most of the other movies in the genre do not show up in the movie title. What a shame.<br /><br />A completely awful film that would drive any major action movie fan crazy. "	1	0
"I have always been a great admirer of Nicolas Roeg's shorts and when I saw that he was making a film as ""The Witness"", I wasn't too surprised at all. That is where I was wrong. This film is just plain bad. The story, the acting, the script, etc. All about as well written as his little mini-series ""Victim"". Honestly, this film just comes across as a video game...an insult to the intelligence of all. I mean seriously, Nicolas Roeg? You're a director, you should know better. Another thing about this film: this is Nicolas Roeg's least successful film. When I heard about this film, I thought, ""This is just another cheesy Roeg film"". But now I realize what a stupid and cliche movie this is. ""The Witness"" just proves to me that you need a director that is truly brilliant. Not just a guy who does basic acting, like Nicolas Roeg does. Or, how about a guy who likes to make a film that actually gets to be scary, or thought provoking, or simply disturbing. That's what I mean by ""Creative Director"". When I think about it, ""Creative Director"" is Roeg's typical job title: a man who likes to shock the audience. Even at his wors"	1	0
I was not expecting much from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised at how well it could be carried. It's at least an entertaining romantic comedy that can be enjoyed over and over again, so it's not like you need to read or talk about it. I had high expectations for it, however, since it was a Jane Austen novel and the poor Elizabeth Brontë adaptation did not turn out so well. The problem was it was pretentious, took too long, and looked phony. Sadly, the book's ending is more than a little silly, and almost made me forget it was an Austen novel at all.<br /><br />Speaking of stupid endings, I've read a few other reviews for this movie that sound quite positive. They didn't even mention the more unpleasant endings--but I would have to say they aren't very pleasant to view, either. I wasn't even upset by the ending I actually saw. 	1	0

"<br /><br />Human Body --- WoW.<br /><br />There are about three shades of gray in this film. <br /><br />The Good --- A bare but moving yet exceedingly moving story (on of the most moving works I've ever seen).<br /><br />The Bad --- A most excruciatingly pointless film with a handful of supposedly cool scenes. <br /><br />This film's Good points include the best fight scenes ever.

"""Protocol"" is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Hawn as a CIA assassin who becomes entranced with a young boy and who is himself trapped between a desire to kill and his family's wishes. When the boy comes to see his father for the first time in years, the parents aren't exactly happy.<br /><br />With such good reviews on the movie's IMDb page (which goes up every day), I was determined to check it out. I didn't want to go into spoiler territory here, but I would only go so far as to say that the plot is predictable and there is no way Goldie will ever give this movie a chance. Of course, when you go into a film with so much expectation attached to it, there's bound to be little that comes to the surface.<br /><br />The problem with this film is that it has a failure of a premise. The audience will be familiar with that notion from a film such as ""Zero Day,"" in which the entire premise is exposed and the use of the fake message is overstated.

"To start off with, since this movie is a remake of Citizen Kane, I would have to say that it is not the best movie ever made. It is not bad, it is not great, and it is not even close to being the worst movie ever. In fact, it is a masterpiece of proportions that could be compared to Miramax's English dub of Lord of the Rings for about 20 years later. The reason why this film had such a significant cult following, and why many people praised it, is not because of the story, but because of the performances. Leslie Howard is an incredible director whose movie writing skills were second to none. He pulled every trick in the book to make a character that was unique and entertaining to watch. To give you an idea of how ""unusual"" Jason Lee is, he was an archeologist, but now he is a detective, a detective who is completely self-involved and easily embarrassed by the circumstances surrounding his actions. He would be embarrassed to be standing at his desk, in front of his computer, and typing. He would be embarrassed to be sitting on the witness stand, surrounded by people who didn't know him. He would be embarrassed to have his actions trail them behind his back and out to the world, where they could prey on them. Instead, Lee give"	1	0
Let me be up-front, I like pulp. However it is very irritating when one is allowed to take it for granted. This is the story of a famous criminal for whom justice is not served, no matter how long it takes. There is no real mystery to the way the cases are handled, the protagonists are shallow and expect a laugh out loud response from the audience. Not that they deserve one. But they do keep their heads down and eat the scenery. Lacking in story, with little suspense, slapstick, and even some good acting, (that's the only attribute I found so far) this is unfortunately in need of some serious cutting. What's worse is that they seem to have been 'tugged' quite a bit for 'game.' There are quite a few of us who liked these movies, and that is a shame to have now lost all interest, along with a couple of other films that I really enjoyed. This one, however is not as engaging as one would hope. 	1	0
Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) thinks he has found the perfect solution for making sure that his ever-growing family doesn't get strung along by a corrupt family: he invites his family's most boring friend, Dom (Dan Nelligan), to stay with his in-laws for a few days.<br /><br />Dom lives with his uncle, Bob (Steven Weber), whose worst habit is killing people (which is just about everyone in this family). Dom is not, in fact, the brightest bulb in the family's most wonderful (and unusual) business, though. Dom has an undiagnosed weak spot that allows him to see things that normal people cannot see.

I thought this was a very good movie. It would have won more Oscar if it were not for the completely ridiculous script. The acting was so bad I could not believe that I really was watching a film that was based on a true story. And the story, that was nothing but a flimsy excuse for something to be pulled off in the movie. It just fell apart after awhile. There was no beginning or end, it just dragged on and on. We were let down the most because of poor script. I just hope to never have to see this again, because I doubt it would have done the honors it did in my opinion. 	1	0
"This is a classic example of an increasing problem with independent productions that begin with a major budget and then cannot seem to make a decent profit. With ""The Year Of The Rooster"" from Fox, they really took the gold standard and made it their own, and when they started to get bombed it brought back memories of ""Midnight Cowboy"", an absolute gem that should never have been made the way it was. The story has everything: drama, comedy, action, a great plot twist, suspense, and the best touch: an old man who shows his family how to dance. There is no other genre that could give me this type of classic feel from beginning to end. The movie is a real treat to watch once it starts to flow. Do yourself a favor: rent a VHS tape from Wal-Mart. It's worth every penny. It's one of those cases of fans being so passionate about a movie that they ask for a refund because they don't like it, but it's actually the viewers who are the ones who should be feeling the disappointment, not the actual film.

"I do not expect this film to be well understood by anybody because it is not a film for the majority of people. It's supposed to appeal to the side of the campy, who like to bring out the worst in people. ""North by Northwest"" is about two hot and very clueless college boys who come to Washington from Wisconsin to collect a trip for their parents for Thanksgiving. One of them is Kyle (John Carradine) who is the straight-laced, loudmouth of their group, and the other, Adam (Matt Stone). It is Adam's graduation day and he's in dire need of money for his college educations. Kyle decides to send money to Adam to get the rest of his buddies for Christmas and Adam wants him to stay there. Adam, the virgin boy doesn't like to have sex, so Kyle and his buddies want to have sex. The script is not hard to follow and ""North by Northwest"" does well in showing how they deal with such problems. After about twenty minutes, the movie changes direction and it's pretty much the same kind of story that has been told in other movies like ""High School Musical"". The movie has a nice plot, but it's very predictable. Adam and Kyle meet in a bar. They hit it off immediately. There is much more drama an"	1	0
"..IT'S THIS ONE! Very cool premise, right off the bat.<br /><br />We all know that Jack Reacher is a really good marksman, but it's also established that he can go several hundred miles per hour with his rifle. What's really interesting is the way he picks up on the distractions and traps around him, right off the bat. The film starts off with him spotting and firing at an animal trail that he's honing, only to have it turn out to be an EMP device.<br /><br />Thing is, this particular film is NOT about EMPs. It's a LONG film about Reacher's mental state and his attachment to what he believes to be a new form of combat - FREEDOM. Why the hell would anyone risk their life, and risk everything else that's in this world, by intentionally being placed in a situation that makes you an idiot? The film goes on to explain that Reacher and his comrades are sent into a forest, where they are trapped in an isolated area, but are attacked by a group of ""parasites"" that they believe are another form of ""infected men"". Well, that's just it; there is no explanation for how these guys manage to turn themselves into all kinds of kung fu masters... and there's absolutely no explanation fo"	0	1
I hate to sound like an 'old person', but frankly I enjoyed this movie. The story is pretty good, and the cast is generally memorable, including former child stars Dwight Frye and Janice Rule. But the movie was far too formulaic and too slow, and so people just didn't laugh and enjoyed it. I thought at times I might be missing something as I watched this movie, but it would've been much better if they had created a lot more good songs! 	0	1
i expected something different:more passion,drama...Again another failed attempt of originality.i'm proud that i missed the real thing.This is not a film that can be appealed to human heart. It wasn't for my taste and i would've loved to see more love between the characters.if the story were close to me,maybe i'd love it,but these requirements are given the director's intention.Another disillusionment for me:the diversity of the cast (maybe the writer was told that's is a good idea...)and drama is not an option in a film.and what can an idea bring to life? To me the only thrilling moment was when i saw that the storm was headed straight for our tiny town.i was so sad that they sacrificed so much for such a stupid attempt at creating a beautiful,drama filled fantasy.I also don't get why i was convinced by the director:even in a fantasy world,there are no saving places.forget the logic behind the movie and get real!the idea is amazing.nothing more,and nothing less.and that is why it was so successful. 	1	0
"""Opening Night"" released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious piece of cinema and fails so badly that it's hard to say who is supposed to be proud of it. Perhaps that's why the movie was so controversial in its day. For most of us, the only way to remember it is to stare at it from the time we saw it for 30 years. What really irked me about this movie was that we don't get to experience the emotions of the characters. We are all familiar with the harrowing escapades of each of the main characters. But the fact that we cannot fully identify with any of them is why ""Opening Night"" is so terrible and depressing. What if I told you the most random person on earth could become one of the most famous actors in the world, a talented painter who won a million dollars in a painting contest, and take in an adoring public, yet have the mental disorder of having two weak bones in his body and an inability to read between the lines? It would be fascinating to see a movie with these characters, and here in ""Basic Instinct 2"" they are never enough. The acting is absolutely atrocious and the plot is so ridiculously stretched. It has so much missing that there is no plot. The plot is as predictable as one ever could expect. Even the scenes w"	1	0
"""May Contain Spoilers*<br /><br />""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" is an awfully dull movie. It's so silly, it's almost unplayable. ""May Contain Spoilers"" really is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is so one-sided and far-fetched you really wonder why they had to film it. All the characters are utterly useless and stereotypical. Don't waste your time with this one. Do not waste your time at all. "	1	0
Not a bad word to say about this film really. This horror gem really doesn't do much for you with it's story. There really is nothing in it to scare you. There is only so much way that you can sit through an hour and a half. The acting is almost non-existent and most of the time you don't even hear the actors talking to each other.<br /><br />One great thing about this movie is that it's nothing for the snotty psychopaths like me. In fact I can't even say that it is a realistic horror movie at all. It is kinda campy and sick and frat bro like stuff.<br /><br />I can't say that this movie was bad by any means but it wasn't that great. 	1	0
Ask yourself where she got the gun? Remember what she did when she shot the gun? How could she even get the gun? Well she was probably just too angry or too crazy to do what she did. If this were a movie with a supporting cast, the rest of the movie would be laughable. Instead we get a bunch of naked women running through the woods because they thought Santa might get there and take them away. It also ends on a gun that doesn't even have a mechanism yet. Guess what, that's what the gun is for. Is that the definition of insanity? <br /><br />However, if you're a teacher and want your students to understand the difference between a good story and a GOOD movie, then watch this movie. All you have to do is remember two facts: the first is that it only lasts a minute and the second is that the people who read the comments were all giving this movie 1 star, even though it was horrible. As a teacher, I cannot believe anyone would even want to take their students to this movie, which is just a total waste of time. 	1	0
The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, who hid out in a Jewish quarter in Tel Aviv and told her story to become an author of children's books about the holocaust. After her book was published in France, she won a scholarship to the US. However, when she had trouble finding work as a publicist and needed to earn a living, she decided to hitchhike to Israel to write about the holocaust for a living. That's when her and the parents came under suspicion and the police took her to the police station and charged her with espionage. Kor got out of jail, stayed in Tel Aviv for a few days and then fled again.<br /><br />I can't understand why Israelis don't understand what's happening with Germany's top spy, the incomparable Wolfgang Lang, and to be honest I almost would like to know why. Germany is a democracy and the director does a good job of explaining what the programme showed the Israeli side. However, there's a scene which throws me: a member of the German police (played by Jan Evers) is asking Kor about the German girls who helped her stay in Tel Aviv. Kor never told him what the girls did for her and Evers actually wants to know if she's a spy or not.<br /><br />At on	0	1
If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this sequel I'd be very interested. If you're just looking for a wonderful underwater film about the Palau Islands to make fun of because you can't find anything really funny in The Great Escape, or a great underwater movie with a good parody of Cube or whatever, then give Atlantis a miss. But if you're looking for some truly weird space trip comedy that's not afraid to go places and has some real talking, I'd definitely recommend Atlantis. 	0	1
Election is a Chinese mob movie, or triads in this case. Jack Oakie is a film director in China. He's been shooting gangster films for about 20 years. He takes a huge risk in making this film. He goes to a street in Sichuan (which is not a terribly interesting location at all) and shoots some redneck gals that happen to be hitchhiking to see who they're going to vote for. One of them goes on a bender and splits up into two different groups. One of them is in their club, the other is riding around on a motorcycle, hopping from town to town. At the end of the movie you're able to see the gals in their split outfits as they race around in these totally chaotic recreations of a biker gang.<br /><br />The acting is not bad for a film of this type, if you can find it. If not, there are a couple parts that are funny, like a movie where a porn star shoots at a machete wielding gangster. While the problem with the film is that you just don't care for these two characters as much as the characters in the original film, it's still fun to watch.<br /><br />Now, the script was fairly predictable. It was heavily based on th	1	0
....after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me!!!! Whatever happened to Zelah Clarke? In the past 10 years she has become a free agent after a brief attempt on her life. In real life she was a reality TV star and then as an actor as well. I do not understand what all the hoopla about her ever is about but she was nothing of the sort in this movie.<br /><br />Why she was even cast as a porn star I will never know, I didn't even recognize her. The rest of the cast is just cheap cast and can act to boot but they are just inane and awful too. This movie is another example of Burton falling down on his face. I can't believe we wasted our money on this braindead waste of celluloid. 	1	0
"The box for ""To Die For"" suckered me in -- it boasted that this was a ""noir-like,"" ""red-blooded gangster movie."" It had Tony Montana, Barbra Streisand, Paul Newman, Robert Blake, and Eric Roberts. I was confused by the entire film.<br /><br />After watching ""To Die For,"" I sat through another unintentionally hilarious movie: ""Alone in the Dark."" Both movies revolved around asinine, overlong sitcom skits and bickering between the super-obnoxious characters. ""Alone in the Dark"" was a sleeper hit that opened for The Brady Bunch in 1964 -- one year before Burt Reynolds' ""The Legend of Frankie Avalon."" When John Wayne returned to direct ""Alone in the Dark,"" producers announced the project as a ""Coming Of Age Story,"" and John Cusack, Richard Widmark, and others had already cast John Huston as Frankie Avalon.<br /><br />But the tone of this film is a bit different from ""Alone in the Dark."" It's not all romantic talk and small talk. Instead, we're treated to a crackling, chaotic battle of wits between Nick Matheson and John Thorn. It's a great laugh -- there are also some truly chilling moments.<b"	0	1
"Michael Keaton is ""Johnny Dangerously"" in this take-off on gangster films.<br /><br />It's a nice little film, with nice touches, like the drug deal gone bad, but the basic plot of the film is just full of predictable gags.

There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler.Fortier is a cut-and-paste job of the 9listed by Fortier; no continuity.The facts of the story are based on individual accounts in only one or two hundred books, and some use of such as Dumont (both French) 'turning the tables' on Strindberg by insinuating that it was his behaviour as a Russian commander which had contributed to the capture of all-important Birnie; Dumont is an anti-imperialist, but not a major imperialist.Fortier's book is a chauvinistic polemic against Europe,the victimhood of Chinese officers in the Russo-Japanese war,the Liberal orthodoxy of French historians (of today's vintage),as well as a pseudo-scientific explanation of the whole period.Despite such a desperate historical situation,I rather like the novel and the movie; and this may be because I have seen Fortier's novel a couple of times. 	1	0
Actually, I never bought into the metal was satanic and made references to satanic blood. I find that some of the things that were discussed in this film are well handled. The plot and supporting characters are good. But the movie just seems to drag. The only good thing about it is the gore and nudity in the first half of the film. I found this film to be unnecessarily graphic and heavy handed. What was the point of showing a killer take the life of a gory girlfriend after she cheated on him? The movie's entire running time was pretty much one segment of gore and nudity. And a cheesy music score that seemed to build and build for far too long. If you want a good old fashioned teen horror flick you might want to give this one a miss. The one I watched went past 5/10. 	1	0
A beautiful shopgirl in London is swept off her feet by wealthy businessman Ian Holm. For some reason, he lives in a castle built in his image. You might call it his 'castle of love', but you don't see any of it. It is a fantasy place. It is breathtakingly photographed with sets, costumes and editing that makes the film seem almost operatic.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Holm is attracted to the shopgirl, a little girl named Alice Lane. In the end, the real reason for their engagement is to resolve a lingering tension between their families, although it does end up being more to do with Mrs Lane than Holm. If it's the real reason, Alice left because she couldn't bear to live with her parents, a lovely lady named Emma, and was too old for Holm's grandmother. If the fantasy is a friendship, he seems more than happy to become her servant, using her as a pillow. There is no love in this film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big fan of films with no plot, very little acting and basically none of the elements that make up a good film. But there's nothing wrong with showing a woman facing a great financial obstacle by escaping from it. Just do it wit	1	0
The way this story played out and the interaction between Palette and Flynn was very different from any other movie I had ever seen. Flynn is there to play a murderer, and Palette is there to play a reporter. There's no real chemistry on screen, and this isn't the first movie where Flynn has played a brutal murderer and Palette the reporter. They play well together in this film, and don't get in the way of what is going on. It is a movie where you wonder what the film was trying to say, and what it was trying to say wasn't always what it was delivering. For example, if Palette had been shooting Flynn or Flynn had been shooting Palette, I think you'd get the feeling that this wasn't really about the killer, the killer wasn't really the point, and the killer wasn't really Palette. I didn't like this movie, but that's because it didn't try to tell me anything I already knew. 	1	0
I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can describe that feeling perfectly to anyone who has ever taken a class in series writing. The pilot caused a virtual revolution in the BSG community. A revolution that is still going strong to this day. I watch and re-watch every BSG episode, eager to watch what they are doing next with the material. But what really sets BSG apart from other Sci-Fi shows is the incredible creativity of their creative team. It is a hard concept for people outside of the Sci-Fi world to understand, but you have to remember that BSG's original pilot is credited with inventing an entire genre of Sci-Fi shorts (Sliders, Music videos, Farscape, Stargate and others). If you think about it, there is a scene where SG1 is on a military base while attempting to steal the powerful weapon, first and only weapon on the planet. The weapon has been stolen by a mysterious outlaw from the Omega code. A brilliant idea, right? Wrong. The first choice of weapon is a mainframe. The rest of the technology is stolen by the military to develop new weapons to defend themselves against the Ori. The Ori have a rather annoying habit of stealing anything which has the Omega code in it, and using it for whatever reason. For example, one episod	0	1
I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to complain about the film's originality. 'The Affair' was originally a horror film, it takes many characters for a horror film to have a horror cast. But who's idea was it to get Chris Cooper in the lead role? Maybe there was a double meaning there. Let's see...no one involved knew what they were getting into when they took on this challenge. Even with the equipment and material, the ideas weren't coherent. A lot of it is just the film following the lead of actual events within the film, but the inconsistencies are mostly excusable. Is the murder that Rhonda suffers really real? Or is the real character her ghost who feels threatened by our audience and simply knows she's going to be blamed when things get out of hand? The psychological mumbo jumbo is really a burden. I understand that the script couldn't make much sense but so what? Everyone involved should take a breath, walk back to your seat and let the next film do the talking. 	1	0
James Gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he learn from looking like the American version of Jack Nicholson? He's not sure yet, but he will make sure to look very much like his old self in this film. They both have great stage presence, as well as some great body movements. Gandolfini in particular looks pretty good with a nice hip split in one jaw and then his legs show what he's really capable of. Another thing that seems to be a little lacking here is Gandolfini's ability to play a real human being. The most memorable character here is played by Stephen Rea, who simply looks like he's coming from another dimension. David Warner is good, and of course there's Kristen Bell (who appears in such films as Batman and Robin) to boot.<br /><br />The story takes place in San Francisco, but the feeling of the movie is that it could have taken place anywhere. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but the setting for the movie was Hong Kong, the type of film that is most famous for its heavy police presence. This allows for the action to be accompanied by some incredible sounding synthesized music. The songs have a certain poetry to them that really enhances the film's message. Some of the songs here take place in the middle of a busy street	0	1

First of all, 'St. Ives' the film is only fairly brief - around 90 minutes. It's also (apparently) the first film Steve McQueen made on an acting career, which is interesting as he did go on to make some fine pieces for the Amigos (such as 'Halloween II') but this is his first effort on film, and his acting (good actors would need to know what they're doing, if there is such a thing) is non-existent. Basically, MacQueen is the Teletubbies' version of Michael from the cartoon. Whatever its intentions, this is crap. McQueen never played an Enigma before so why waste your time on this? 	1	0

"The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects that plagued American horror movies in the late 70s and early 80s. While trying to appeal to a modern audience, the horror was becoming too much contrived and too formulaic. The plot is cliched and predictable, the character arcs so uneven that they are impossible to identify with or even understand. While it does strive for something good in the context of the period, ""The Drug Years"" comes off as tepid at best.<br /><br />Lets just say that this is a shame. Perhaps one day, we can recapture that magic we once had in these movies that relied so heavily on ""heart"" to make the audience believe things would happen for real. Maybe then we'll be able to have our fantasies become reality. "	1	0

"The book on which this movie is based was excellent; this adaptation just seems to be more of the same.

First off, this movie was a wild ride the whole way around. When I first saw it I was completely excited. I had seen Chris Rock's first film, BIG BANG THEORY and was into all of his later movies. So, when I saw the box for Spinal Tap, my expectations were pretty high, even though it was against the rules of box office just because it was an independent film. But, I thought this was going to be one of the more campy superhero movies.<br /><br />I was right. As most of the reviews will attest to, it was a cheesy and unbelievable movie. It had a style that looked nothing like those other movies. The art was just cheap and laughable. That just goes to show you how creative the writers/producers could have been, it was all so mismatched, so lame, and the acting was as weak as a dirt bike.<br /><br />I thought Spinal Tap had a lot to answer for, most of which was the way it was directed. The story line, the direction, the writing, it all just didn't make sense. But I digress, what I like most about the movie was the acting. On paper, it looked like I would not be picking up any Oscar votes for this movie, but i	1	0
"Who would think Andy Griffith's ""Helen Crump"" (Aneta Corsaut) had such charisma and facial beauty? It's really not very hard to see why her Oscar and Golden Globe wins were almost undistinguished. Her performance in this film is really quite remarkable. In fact, I have to admit that I just about disliked this movie when I was young and having it so much on my mind that I wasted way too much time with it. It's hard for me to understand how such a popular, down-to-Earth film is so ultimately disappointed. It's not just that the story isn't sufficiently involving and the plot is convoluted. There are really no discernible aspects of this movie that might seem like it's a flop. She shines as well as anyone in this movie and still does so, to my dismay.<br /><br />The acting has a certain charm to it, too, in contrast to the usual Hollywood point-of-view character. Richard Farnsworth is remarkable in this, too, and seems to possess the same amiable nature that only an absolute perfectionist like Griffith could have. But even more impressive is André Bruhl. His Oscar nomination is quite difficult to swallow and, at times, it felt as though he was deliberately trying to deny the fact that he won this film. But even he couldn'"	1	0

"Today if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen the response will invariably be ""anyone can do it."" That's what I've seen here, but that's not necessarily the case. The majority of the writing and directing that went into this film was done by a small group of four people, Brendan Gleeson, Jordan Salkin, Ryan Lane, and Warren Phillips. Each acted as one of their own writers/directors and produced a script that was shot in the ""softer"" town of Silverton, Colorado in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, in real time.<br /><br />Sounds great. Well, not until I saw the finished film did I realize that this ""act"" was never supposed to be taken seriously as a feature film (nor is it, to my knowledge), but in the process of making this movie, they basically took on a reality that the writer/director had seen in his own mind of what a piece of television should look like. I mean, it really had nothing to do with that one episode of ""The Amazing World of Gumball"" that was originally meant to be the source material for this movie (although in fact that was actually used, with production ceasing before the scripts were ever completed).<br /><br />Let me say it again: on film th"	1	0
I've read a few of the reviews and I'm kinda wondering why people rate this so high. It's not that I don't like Neil Gaiman. I do like his work and I really am a huge fan of his two books of his. The thing I am NOT getting is that I dislike this movie (At all). So many people seem to think it's so terrible because it has some plot holes that they can't figure out. Well, that's not how a lot of Neil Gaiman fans are. It's that Gaiman is one of the most obsessive and imaginative writers out there. I suppose that most people think that because of his books it makes him terrible to watch. I can't say that for EVERY Neil Gaiman fan. Some like him so much that I have actually fallen into that camp. A lot of people enjoy the style and the stories, so I can understand what they're saying. But this movie just isn't much better. It doesn't really have much of a plot to speak of, the acting is okay, the music is good, and the special effects are awesome. And I'm not talking about the vampires from Gabriel's Gate. I mean the shapeshifting effects that come from ripping out the lips of a vampire. I mean you've probably seen this look just a few time	1	0
Valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle for symbolism and genre. The action is creative, but that's not the point.<br /><br />Even with the racing, there's a lack of rational thought on the part of the characters. I like many Indian films, and indeed they offer characters with a variety of shades of grey, but their speeches are annoying.<br /><br />These characters are so compromised by the inherent conflict of an earlier age, and so fraught with alienation that the idea of talking to them is just pure torture. A revelation is inevitable; but in the end there's too little desire to create a deeper meaning.<br /><br />If I was a Desi director working on this film, I'd find something else to do, and perhaps pursue music more. 	1	0
"""They were always trying to get me killed,"" Alec Guinness tells Theo Francis (David Niven) as he tries to complete a job for him. This is the first meeting in the film of Guinness, an actor who found work with Niven in his early years, and who seems to have a knack for proving someone wrong, whether it's with good or bad advice.<br /><br />This period in Guinness's life is marked by a string of murder cases, from a schoolgirl brutally murdered by the same man that killed his mother, to the famous ""Mumbai Rose"", who was found sitting in her bed unharmed in the following year's Jane Eyre.<br /><br />Niven's leading lady is Kate Winslet, who looks lovely and exudes a sugary sweetness throughout the film, and we can expect something of the sort from her, too, in later years. She comes off very natural and convincing as a mature lady with more wisdom and insight to offer than we'd expect from an older, stock character such as this. Unfortunately, it's not that she's particularly likable, or that she's anything special in real life. She's something of a sleazy sexpot with a penchant for getting boned.

Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out about the same time as the extremely cheesy 1984 sequel to the far superior SpaceCamp. This film is not bad by any stretch. It's certainly not the worst or even the best film I've ever seen, but it does have a very short shelf life. In the vein of Grease 2, most of the original 70s kids characters would only appear sporadically in this film. There is a fairly credible special effects team that worked on this, and their stunt work alone should be enough to earn a place in the Top 25. The dialogue is moderately entertaining, and I was pleasantly surprised by the occasional visual gag. However, these laughs come after you've seen the first two in your lifetime.<br /><br />SpaceCamp II comes with it's own DVD containing commentary from the film's original cast and crew, some deleted scenes, a deleted video, and an art print of the original poster. For those of you looking for the instant victory with a Criterion release, you might want to look elsewhere. However, for the vast majority of people, the fun and hilarity of this film has already been experienced years earlier by the die-hard SpaceCamp fans.

Watch the team carry on because they are trying to figure out what happened to the thousands of people in the hospital when the wall of rubble suddenly collapses from the high voltage explosion at the beginning. When you finally see them exiting the hospital you almost feel sorry for them. Some folks on here who have seen the original, I give them the benefit of the doubt. If you go to the movie you can just ignore the disastrous ending and get on with watching the initial rescue attempt. It is hard to imagine anyone walking through that wall on a two man team of bomb technicians and safety experts...its hard to imagine anyone even considering a go around trying to figure out what had actually happened with so many people trapped in the room with the two locked doors. An excellent story with good actors and good special effects...but there are so many more films that are simply better films to take a look at and stop and think about. 	0	1
"While it does crack the odd good joke, the humour is feeble and flat. The presenters have their moments, but it is pretty dull. There is more than enough real life examples to draw from, but as with any film, they are written and performed to the music in the same way.<br /><br />Now about the moments - the song 'Everything was Perfect', released at the same time as ""The Last Picture Show"" was, is simply perfect.

"This game has the(dis)honor of being the first game that made Jim Sterling look like a real person. The basic concept is to run around beating the crap out of people while trying to grab a pill and go on a suicide mission. If you do this, and the game ends in a low-scoring situation you win. I won 5 times in one game. When you find out why this game is called ""Final Fantasy"" I suggest you get your health back and use it. "	0	1
This was a typical grade B movie in 1940s Hollywood. Acting was fairly good, and the visual effects were good. The story had potential, but for the most part, the script and acting were not up to par. If you're a fan of B-listers like Peter Sellers or Bruce Willis, this is not for you. <br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie has long since faded into the past. Those of us who still collect B-lister memorabilia have preserved it, and it's a true piece of movie history. 	1	0
"1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was also when he became the first person to ever play the lead in a biopic (Otto Preminger did it in 1954, but it was because I love him so much that I gave it a ""1"") but it was the 1915 release of THE BRONZE DOLL that truly set the standards for all biopic films in the history of cinema. In it he portrayed a deeply troubled man who was able to look past what was bothering him to see the beauty of his life. And it is the beauty of life that really makes this film.<br /><br />Chaplin's cinematography (yes, that's the right word) is brilliant throughout the film. Even his performances are beautifully filmed. What I can say about Chaplin is that he is the ultimate perfectionist. Not only did he pick the most fantastic locations to shoot in, but he also spent months of editing together his amazing scripts. That, my friends, is masterfully professional. I've never seen any other filmmaker in which he had that much control over the film. And that can be seen when we watch the beautiful scene in which Charlie dons the brand new wheelchair that Preminger gives him. His character, Gordon Brown, plays the role with consummate effectiveness"	0	1
While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action!), it still left me not too satisfied. It was like the author wanted us to expect that he will plot the story out. So I was mostly disappointed and found this movie rather complicated and much more of a puzzle than the first. Basically, how does an alligator split into two different alligators and why did their lifestyles differ at all? That would have been a lot easier to explain in the first movie. 	1	0
Honestly before I watched this movie, I had heard many bad things about this movie. I could see that this movie was not as good as the ones I had seen before, but at the same time, I could see that it was still a great movie. I have seen many bad movies, many good movies and this is probably one of the best. It has great acting and visuals and there are many cool scenes in the movie. Even with all the bad effects, I was still impressed by the visuals of the movie. It is not a sure thing that the human eye can perceive anything from a distance, however, this movie allows it to. This movie really touches your heart and your mind. 	0	1
"After, I watched the films... I thought, ""Why the heck did she continue with this even after Dreyfus had already left the movie?"". I mean, it was ridiculous, and she was playing the part of a fallen star for her whole life. It was a lot of tough love. I laughed at every joke that I heard about being on The Man Show and got off on Eddie flopping his butt on her about his love life... and then at the end, it is Dreyfus admitting that he was on The Man Show, and she does a good dance in front of him. They are unbelievable. She should do more movies. She was terrible as Amy (Francesca J. DeJoria). Eddie had just learned how to talk and dance at the age of 2 (taking piano lessons, and so on). His singing and dancing skills have become a huge part of his live act. That is just sad. And even the stupid laughs with some poor old lady, like ""Luv you loser"", for a whole second made me say, ""I know you are a celebrity, but do you want to be buried in this crap!?"" Please, Do not make another movie, not even for children. It made me feel sorry for it's director, Bill Furman (the rest of the cast). H"	1	0
"This movie is best described or compare to ""Big Fish"" by Shelley Duvall. The major difference is that ""Big Fish"" has bigger cast and more action. While ""Vampire's Kiss"" is about a blind woman who becomes engaged to a rich man, ""Scream"" is a suspense film about the rape of a dead girl. While the characters are nice in their characterization, this movie had me anxious to see more of these people and their actions. The film, with its suspense and gore, is not for everyone, but I think it's a good ending to this sad story. The only drawback I had was that I didn't find the actress Julie Andrews attractive. I find that a real problem with many sequels to horror films. It often takes away from the tension, the suspense and suspense they are trying to build. Also, the acting was not up to par. I wanted to like Scott Glenn, but it just didn't work out like I expected it to. "	1	0
While I had wanted to se this film since the date first posted and was looking forward to seeing it, I was very disappointed with my time at the theatre. Since I had seen the trailer and that it was seen by over 100 people, I had been very prepared for this film. I suppose that many people would be disappointed if they didn't go out and see it first.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed when the film really didn't go anywhere! I mean it had promise. I had read it a few years before and had had a decent idea about what it was about, although I didn't expect it to be so bad.<br /><br />What I was really disappointed by was how slow it was going. At first it seemed to get a lot better every minute or so, but it just seemed like a film from the middle to end. I understand that the budget was not very big and it may be very unrealistic to expect something that large, but I just felt that when it was at its heart it was not that great. The director just didn't know how to put it together. To this day I still watch the trailer and for some reason, I still think it was a shame that I wasted my time watching it.

Paul (Jason Lee) is an underachiever who just happens to get screwed over by the love of his life. When he turns up for her memorial, they're both charged with having an affair. While they get off with just a warning, Paul is accused of having a child out of wedlock, despite his IQ saying otherwise. While Paul tries to prove he's innocent, he decides he needs to find out if there's more to his explanation. While he's away, he and Lila decide to embark on a road trip that will take them on a trip to the depths of hell and love. When the sparks begin to fly between them, it can't stay contained anymore.<br /><br />I first saw this movie when it came out in 1989. At the time, the part was rated PG-13, and I have to admit, it wasn't all that scary. I remember being very scared as the movie dragged on. That is until about two minutes into the movie, when I found myself thinking 'Oh, I'm not watching that again. My head is starting to hurt. This isn't going to work for me any more.' Well, I later found out that it's not just the horror factor that pushes this movie into the bad category, it's also the romance sub-plot that can put yo	1	0
"Alain Chabat claims this movie as his original idea but with Nicolas Cage as the lead, it will be hard to claim that. Though Cage is rather small in this picture, he certainly has some physical screen presence to match his acting talent. The movie is one to see if you can find a cinema near you with a 4am slot that will open to show this movie. Good Movies like this one help to slowly erode the credibility in the advertising and can really make the ""viral"" effect noticeable. "	1	0
Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the fantastic spoof which tried to use the netherworld for its own purposes is bad film, some are good, others are just plain bad. This is not the worst film that I have ever seen, it is in fact among the very few genuinely bad films that I have seen and this is perhaps the main reason why I gave this film 5 out of 10 stars. The whole episode however, would not be complete without the oud which sums up everything we have just seen. 	1	0
I have heard a lot about this film, with people calling it one of the best British films of the 20th century. I must confess, I had no idea what to expect when I bought the DVD of this film. It was quite a revelation. I was very impressed by the quality of photography in this film. I didn't expect it to be this poor in terms of scenery and dialogue. But I didn't care. It really is very good. It is not, I believe, the finest film of the 20th century, but it is good, and worth seeing.<br /><br />Plot: Some guy starts out as a miner, goes down hill and ends up as a well-to-do gambler. Can you believe it? Well, I'm a betty gamblers I am, and I will explain.<br /><br />Casting: I won't go into details, but will say that some of the casting was pretty funny. Yes, there are some actors with exaggerated voices, and even some scenes are not all that well done. But the problem is that this was a TV film and it just wasn't realistic. There are other films with a similar plot, but they are rarely as good or as accurate as this. At least they aren't made for television. So thi	0	1
I think the majority of the people seem not the least bit pleased with this film, or can't care if it is a disaster or a comedy. The whole notion of a western in 18th century Canada is original to me. As a Canadian, I was very curious to see this and enjoyed it immensely. It is actually quite brilliant in how it dealt with those problems we encounter today in most westerns and how it created some laughs. Not that I'm the least bit against westerns, especially when I am the sort of person that wants to see a good western. However, with the nature of comedy in general and certain aspects of the films I watched like this one, I found that the film was very poorly paced and none of it came together in any effective way. I was disappointed by how little of the story was told and how the characters felt and acted, especially the one played by Scatman Crothers. If you are looking for a film with a single, straightforward story, look no further. I have never been so disappointed in a film, with or without a really good actor. 	1	0
"1st watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Carl Macek): ""The World's Greatest Storyteller"" is a documentary film of Carl Macek. Macek is an American Academy Award-winning director and TV personality. He is best known for the live shows he produced on the Laurel and Hardy television show, which featured actor William Powell, former Beatle David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen. He also produced the film American Prophecy and was the producer of the SCTV television series. Macek is the author of the best-selling science fiction book, Galactic Civilizations and has over 26 other novels to his credit. He has also produced other films including Carl Macek: Night of the Apes, Carl Macek: Beyond Space and Time, Carl Macek: A New Beginning and Carl Macek: The World's Greatest Storyteller.<br /><br />'The World's Greatest Storyteller' is not about a television star and his fame, but a documentary about a legend. Macek's work was part of the story. According to the film, the book's plot was based on in-depth interviews with Macek's book readers. The movie shows a similar structure to the book. Macek's interviews with his book readers was recorded by broadcast journalist Donald Berwick on the Station Wes"	0	1
"As I said in my comment about the first part: this movie could have been so much better. The stage play is so good that if the plot was so bad it would be painful. You would not see the plot as you would if the movie was an over-acting competition. The most horrendous thing about this movie, however, is that all the actors play themselves. Great actresses like Megan Fox and Amy Poehler are so horrible at their roles that you don't even have the notion that they might be in the movie. I am not against actors doing ""actors"" roles in movies, but the ineptitude of this movie's actors is beyond belief. Apparently they went in with so much money to make this movie they decided to jump through all the hoops that actors have to have, then proceeded to write a song and dance about how awful the movie is. This is why I have seen other people saying that the movie ""was a disaster"" because people did not realize that they are literally reading the dialogue on cue cards. "	1	0
"Deceptive Advertising... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way: Rise of Evil about 10 years ago. ""Let's ask one more time: Who paid to let this film be released in the United States?"" said the voice-over. The message was that people who see a film like this have to be gullible because they're ""fed up with what they see on the screen."" Well guess what? They don't see as much on the screen. Of course, this is an ""ad"" anyway. Apparently, the things that people are eating/drinking in the world today are labeled as ""spices"" etc. Even though most of what is labeled as food today has no nutritional value and is in fact made from harmful additives and synthetic chemicals (like glyphosate). People think that because a ""cause is promoted on a video, that it means something"" - i.e. when a ""cause"" is promoted on a video that should mean something! Well guess what? Most of what the media (and Big Media especially) are now producing is propaganda. It's nothing but fear-mongering. And even though we all know that Government is NOT behind everything (and even though it always needs a good lobby to protect its interests), it's STILL very effective in using fear and deception in order to control people.

"Greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated shorts... Let's see, this one is about a girl with a jetpack, who must team up with a mean dragon. From that the whole story goes on in this underground world with an extra. The plot has been done a dozen times already and ""Falling Down"" is still a watchable 80's cartoon.<br /><br />Well, I know this film is quite old, but I think, that if made today (like the first one was) it would be very popular. I agree that bad animation (and bad word...) are best avoided and ""Falling Down"" might actually do better than the first one, as I think it proves that bad animation does not hurt the audience any. <br /><br />At the end, the young dragon spends a lot of time under a bridge, in an abandoned house. That is what makes it special. "	1	0
So this made for TV film scores only a 7.6 (actually - 7.3) on my formulae. The story has serious problems and is very slow moving. The studio was unable to get it right and it left me cold. There is a very good song by John Williams, albeit one which isn't to everyone's taste. One of the worst fails I've seen for one reason or another and it's not because it's unfunny. It's because, for some inexplicable reason or another, the characters were not given the character depth that the story demanded. Sure the kids are likable enough. There's even a scene in which the dad rails against his wife and kids, and the son steps in front of him and insults him for it. While an insult, the lad fails miserably. The children are all competent actors, but no one (nearly) has any depth. There's a scene where the kids tell a joke about their feelings towards the sea, but it's totally uncalled for. I'm not saying that the character development in that scene is so bad that it's worth bugging the actors to tell it but when the solution is to constantly remind the audience that it's wrong to cheat on your spouse, that's an awful movie choice.<br /><br />The plot i	1	0
Hear are some of the interesting things our combat hero does throughout the movie. He has a cool gun and he has a cool shirt (e.g. as shown in the opening shot). He's also very aggressive and fast. All of these things are in the movie's favor. The storyline is silly and made-for-TV and never does come together with any logic.<br /><br />However, the special effects were what got me the most. The diorama sequences are breathtaking. I like to view the inside of the rooms of a school because it creates an atmosphere of mystery. Watching the scenes from inside the school to see the symbols created from those rooms is quite a story-book experience.<br /><br />This movie has great dramatic value and a very touching conclusion with some very real action. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good time watching a good movie with a lot of action and lots of tearjerking moments.<br /><br />7 out of 10 	0	1
"This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Mr. Bacon's career. The character on the box was great, and all his other roles were great. Although I had seen the movie ""Malaise"" on TV a few years earlier, I was not familiar with the character, nor his origins in the play. However, I saw the movie with some friends who enjoyed ""La Capri"", so I had a chance to see more of the character. The ""Malaise"" parody was a great example of the type of film one could work on while still retaining their integrity. An undervalued title was quickly transformed into a real commercial success.<br /><br />As a first-time director, Bacon still carried his reputation with him. By allowing the audience to be entertained during some of the more dangerous moments, Bacon avoided the pitfalls that would have been fatal to a successful production. However, the movie still suffered from its trite storyline. There were some scenes, however, that seemed more daring than the play. In particular, the death scene, ""The Ice Man's Dream"", was well done. The viewers were introduced to some seriously cool gangsters, who got a little too serious at some points.<br /><br />Although the death scenes could have been better, and some of the dialogu"	0	1
"The original Lensman series of novels is a classic of science fiction writing and it is this series that I am going to use to examine how the writer of ""The Invisible Man"" attempted to fill in the historical narrative gaps in this film. The movie's following the book was novel for the time frame and provides just enough to fill in the blank because the events have only been hinted at and thus are left open for interpretation. The novel plot is kept very close to the text, and its pacing is paced right. The final episode, ""The End"", was a great finale to this series and I'm not ashamed to admit that it was about the best part of the movie. That it had a very good ending is very admirable and shows that both the writer and director didn't try to be dramatic but focused on the story. The story itself should be considered top notch and the actors and crew give their all in building a tight story that never breaks. No spoiler here. However, ""The Invisible Man"" fails in almost every level, from the scenario to the script to the acting. The main character is supposed to be a responsible man who has known problems but attempts to solve them in his own time. So the audience does not believe he was truly the world's first ""global citizen"". Instead, he is merely a loose canno"	0	1
"Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good few sequels before his short lived run in ""The Warriors"" (1932). Tarzan has been left in charge of a tribe of jungle savages who have taken over the nearby Darron Capital. The people of this tribe are far from ferocious and rude but they are superior martial artists and powerful warlords with guns of brilliant caliber. Yes, there's even a bit of gratuitous black humor in this film. This, in itself is not terrible; the period is interesting, the action is somewhat suitable, the costumes are superb and the action sequences and stunts are exciting. However, this is where the movie falters a bit. For one, the action sequences are awfully badly choreographed and there are too many idle and irrelevant re-do scenes throughout the film. The reason is simple; the acting is too mechanical, everything is as mechanical as a mechanical pipe. There are many scenes where the actors suddenly change their facial expressions and the tone of their voices; perhaps this is a necessary change for the success of the character. If you are a fan of Tarzan, by all means, watch this film as a Tarzan film with some of the nice cast members but there are too many conventions of the Tarzan series that detract from what is simply a wonderful good film"	0	1
"I don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, or whether they say it's a bad movie, or how many people don't understand the plot, or how horrible the movie is, or how ""boring"" it is, or how dry and unfunny it is, or how it insults most religious beliefs. I really don't care. I think anyone who comes across Purple Rain could understand this movie if they had a chance to see it. The movie is about a group of losers who quit their day jobs to become the best of the best. The lead actor, Willie Nelson, is very much likable and funny in this movie, but he doesn't give his character any depth. I would have loved to see him grow into more of a character (even if it is a cliché), because he is the only one in this movie that really lets you know that he is a loser. The beginning of the movie may have been weird, but once you get past the weird, you get to see that Willie Nelson is a pretty good actor. The second half of the movie is the most compelling part of the movie. The acting is pretty bad for this film, but the acting is the only thing that keeps this movie moving.

I should admit first I am a huge fan of Louis CK and his stand-up; but I am not a true fan of comedy, even if that is where I am born.

There is so much that is wrong with this film, it hurts my teeth. The character that John Piscopo played in this movie, which is so deadpan, is given a piece of this film and its characters to play off of. The story, the acting, the script, etc. Even when you are watching this movie, you are often wondering how it came about that these things actually happened. This is the film you can either love or hate, but, I'd advise you watch it, it is really a real treat. The cast, in addition to Stephen Dorff, does a fabulous job with their roles. Brannon Braga does what he does best, which is to not play the traditional cowboy in his films. This film has little in the way of a typical cowboy storyline. The best part of the movie was the ending. I think a number of the actors were so overcome with emotion that they went into non-speaking roles. But they all played a role in the script. Everyone did a very good job with their parts, including the young daughter of the lead character. The film is well made and I thought it made for a great film. But I have to give it to director Robert Lopez, he knew what he was doing, he knew how to show his characters emotion, so i	0	1

For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: Jabba's palace, the attacks on the Death Star, the huge battle at Endor. And it's indeed a great movie, which can be improved if we could think of what the movie was really all about: building the characters, tying them together. But, because this movie is really a fast-paced action adventure flick, we don't see much of the character development.<br /><br />The short, as so often is the case, is so crazy, that it's almost impossible to follow its characters through it.

This movie completely ran laps around the original Dolemite. It had ridiculous martial arts scenes, and as if to further push the idea of martial arts, there was a film explaining to the audience that Dolemite was an inspiration to Japanese Samurai (as well as to the American gangsters in A Streetcar Named Desire). And, just like that, this made the original Dolemite redundant and unbelievable. Go figure.<br /><br />The actual Dolemite is in a different style than the depiction in the film, but the film's total reliance on the true nature of Dolemite is why the remake was such a disaster. As an aside, those scenes where Dolemite uses a chakram to stab Arnold Schwarzenegger are truly chilling. My favorite scene was the scene in a alley between Arnold and the police, with the knife stabbing the fish tank. This is where the 'psychological' element in the film comes into play. A sequence near the end where Dolemite convinces the sheriff to grant him a new identity is truly chilling. The actor who played this character, Paul Devlin, has his own character development in this movie as well, but he's playing the part of an older character who's obsessed with his boss, and does not like taking orders from anybody.

Is there any other time period that has been so analyzed over and over and over and over again? Is there any other time period where the evil of war and greed and blood lust and despair are so exhaustively analyzed to the point that it becomes an almost crescendo of content? Absolutely not. However, the passion and wit of Busby Berkeley was presented in just such a manner in this film and it is an achievement as well as a visual shock. It is a beauty from start to finish, and is better than any of the fine movies of the seventies.<br /><br />Personally, I find this film art-house in its depiction of life and all that is in it. It is gripping and entertaining and unlike any other film it leaves the viewer in a somber mood that is so strong and real that this is very worth seeing. 	0	1
This is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an unfortunate downfall after its release. The film was then apparently turned into a bad comedy which I believe it was. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if the cast and crew were correct in their opinion of the film, that it was the product of vanity and greed on the part of Polanski. Now, I'm no critic of Sidney Lumet. He's probably one of the greatest directors of our time, he's just, I'm sorry to say, a person that doesn't want to be associated with a number of projects (even some of his more laughable ones). However, he could not help but lose credibility when it came to his much-loved cult classic Moonlighting. Now, I'd never heard of the film, and while it certainly wasn't a big name, it certainly was being photographed and shot, so I was expecting it to be something that would sit well with my other expectations.<br /><br />I didn't see much of what I was looking for, which is a little disappointing, but it was the end result that really flopped. The initial concept is excellent and leads to some interesting things in the first five minutes, but then it degenerates into almost a bad soap opera, like anything bad goes.

As they go further into the woods, they find out that she is actually a woman, and not just some harpy.<br /><br />No escape for them as the woman begins to eat them.<br /><br />Well, I don't really like horror movies, but I am a big fan of both Audrey Tautou and Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

"As good an advert for republicanism as you're ever likely to find in your life, it's really not all that bad. The plot involves a bunch of former employees of a company which are accused of being involved in the murder of a fellow employee. The main problem is that so many of the protagonists are portrayed as dim-witted cynics who are completely obsessed with their thoughts about these matters. At one point the main character talks about the topic of ""social comment"" a lot and compares it with ""chick-fil-a"" and ""how the time flies"", remarking that he doesn't eat after five minutes (of course, this is impossible considering he says it with his head in the sand). There are also plenty of amusing moments like this which actually make this a more enjoyable television viewing experience. The group of people included all have different personalities and there is really not a single person on this TV that you don't think ""I'll hate them all"". The supporting cast - which also includes one annoying Brit for the whole show - are all very annoying, but are used to their parts as they are. You can pretty much picture how most people will react to the characters they are given to play and there's absolutely no point in trying to argue with their opinions because they won't hold up after a few minute"	0	1
Just kidding.<br /><br />Seeking greener pastures in the form of video rentals and crackers, I check out the latest local dog kennel craze and make a quick impression. The owner, Robert (Nathan Lane) was kind enough to put me in touch with the owner of the little rascal that starts crapping in my kitchen every now and again. Big mistake. Robert invites me out to his house for a few days and lets me stay with his dog-lovers-come-to-life-in-the-moist-room. I get worried that Robert may have an explosive new canine on the loose and there's a danger of everything exploding...but no, at least the two of them seem relaxed and friendly with each other (which should tell you something)<br /><br />The second part of my tour of Robert's home is a couple of car rides up to his yard. What can I say? I feel awkward about asking questions in front of these two underlings. Being the kind, intelligent, curious person I am, I find it hard to put any pressure on them. There's something about being friends with dogs and having your own pet that I don't want to lose. Something has to give.

"First of all, I liked very much the central idea of redemption and redemption in the life of his character. It was an interesting concept for a movie. It was slightly kind of entertaining, but it was no game plan to make it long-lasting. The only way that this idea could be entertained was if they used a vehicle like Star Wars or the Wizard of Oz to fill up the screen with beautiful colors and amazing special effects. Unfortunately, they never did that. The ""revenge is based upon love"" idea is left to the fantasy world of science fiction, where it falls flat in the film. Characters have too much personality to make an emotional connection with anyone other than their own natural love, and in the end everything changes because of something that happened on another planet. They are the viewers responsibility to learn to understand the character of Parker Posey and understand that all the scenes in the movie are not true and that her choice of moving in the direction she does is really the choice of our film. By the end of the film, I simply wanted to get back to my physical place, and was tired of having to watch the repeated computer screens as Parker Posey moves about the park in a body double. If this kind of relationship was alive in the 80s, this movie could've been a major commercial success. Howeve"	1	0
Unfortunately, in cases such as these, there are so many films dealing with mental illness that it's almost impossible to list them all. Some films I must say I've enjoyed, but many I find hard to watch. At this point in my life, I had a few options to watch; the obligatory Stephen Chow vehicle (Eyes Wide Shut, Pacific Heat, Short Cuts), Shaun of the Dead (well, not that one), Richard Gere's American Psycho, or, of course, one of the most popular (and I use the word popular loosely) of them all - Band of Brothers. I opted for Band of Brothers. What I got was another ludicrous attempt at making a piece of work of any kind and presenting it as being horrible. Like some types of children's fables that portray monstrous beings, the film's four leads try to prove their worth by outsmarting a brutal gang of killers that are trying to kill them for a sixth straight day. Utterly and utterly ridiculous, Band of Brothers is a look at the makers of a total disaster, with some of the most ridiculous dialogue I've ever heard. Director Sam Mendes attempts to make you believe that these characters and their wicked ways are interesting to watch, but actually, it just makes the movie worse. Mendes has good intentions, but hi	1	0
"Spoiler!! I love Branagh, love Helena Bonham-Carter, loved them together in dramas like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and WEDDING ROSE, and you'd think that she would have more of a chance with ILLUSTRATED BY KEVIN. My concerns are that the screenplay for FEBRUARY SHAKESPEARE, which would have been THE STEPBLES if this had been his first film, seems to have been written by a 15-year-old. Branagh and Bonham-Carter are not ""big time"" stars - but given that they are both in roles that probably require some length of time in order to convince people that they are both at the same level of talent (which they are), it may have been easier to write a play than make one of the most star-studded, widely acclaimed screenplays to date.

I saw the trailer to this film and it looked pretty intriguing to me. I have to say, I was going to say this movie is pretty good, but...it's really not that good. It's still one of those crazy-funny-fans movies that you get a chuckle out of when you have just watched it the first time. There are some dumb twists and turns and half-funny but well-planned out jokes. It's not that the film is shallow; after all, it's just a couple of friends making out, and since it has no plot, it's kinda freaky in that sense. In fact, there were times when I just wanted to go to the bathroom and vomit and groan like a brick. Not all the jokes, of course; when you have a story and a dumb premise, you still have to be realistic. I thought that the script was well-written and well-argued--the scriptwriter was probably a smart guy, though. Sure, the main character is sort of a frat-boy with a lot of heart who really needs to find his soulmate. That said, the movie has a couple of people that end up together that are genuinely cool. Once that happens, the rest of the movie begins to build--characters who nee	0	1
"/The first episode I saw of Lost made me think, if anyone really thinks that you can make a show out of T.V. clips, then I think you'll be in business. At least the network did not keep me waiting with the repeat on the P.O. box. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series, but my biggest complaint was the slow pacing of the episodes.<br /><br />Why they did not continue this after season 2 I do not know, as this seemed to drag on to a point where the series was over before it had a chance to succeed.<br /><br />It would have been better if the network had picked another catch phrase for the TV show, for example: ""Plot twist...subplot...counter plot twist...""<br /><br />Lost was a good show, and my opinions of it were very deep, but I was disappointed that the network wanted to stop this good show from being finished.<br /><br />1 of 10 stars "	1	0
Just to mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I really appreciate how hard he tried to make this film a home run. The acting was over the top, the storyline was too convoluted, and the story didn't really make sense. If it wasn't for the fact that they used the Gaffer's cheat sheet and the wonderful commentary from Ben Affleck, this film would never have got made. When he explained that the story just happened to fit in the middle of the S.S. crew filming in the middle of the day, I had to watch the rest of the movie and stop it. I appreciated that they gave him the tools to move the movie forward and without having to worry about the rest of the crew ruining it for him. It could have easily gone the way of a sequel if there wasn't a follow-up made after the second feature. (A sequel to a sequel that's already been made would have been much better) 7 out of 10 	1	0
"I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it. Well, as luck would have it, I found it in the video store. I remember sitting in an extra large section where I only had a couple of high end video cards. It was such a shame, because the video quality was great. I rented it thinking it would be good. Of course I was wrong. At first I watched it thinking it would be fairly decent, but then one of the characters said ""It's a great movie!!!"" Very funny! I am going to take a try at doing a full cast review now. For all of the gore and stunt work in this movie, you will probably laugh your little heart out. I was so surprised with my roommate's reactions to this movie and how effective it was that I was glad he watched it. I would give it an 8. "	0	1
"A clever, undeniably entertaining romp starring Peter Ustinov as a western fugitive - having made the ill-fated German ""The Most Dangerous Game"", of which he was the infamous ""redneck"" rather than the shoot-ass Cheyenne - and Jean Arthur as a small-town girl with a crooked husband who tries to outwit him and his loyalist band of outlaws.<br /><br />If this review is to be believed, our federal government has been involved in a plot against the Sioux for all of over five years, and that Ustinov has been dispatched to federal prison on a grossly trumped-up charge of being the top wolfman in that plot. So, the government is trying to assassinate him (can they still shoot people?) but is unable to. Therefore, Arthur (he of the head-shot sequence) makes it to the most remote and unguarded part of the United States and attempts to slip in across the border by posing as a ""tax collector"" - but fails. We are never told why she was so reckless, or where she was from. Why not just run off to Mexico? What does she mean to these gun-fighters and the rest of the plot? And why are we supposed to care about this for four hours? Shouldn't we just be bored an"	1	0
This movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it just surprised me how bad it was. The direction is usually very good, and so does the acting, but I felt that the direction in this movie was down right awful. It just felt so poorly done, the entire movie felt like the person directing you got bored and so didn't give you anything to work with. The ending sucked so bad. We get this guy that's leading us to some kind of unknown place, a mustang chase that involves some well known bad guys, and the main character doesn't know where he's going. The final 20 minutes was really awkward and never gave you anything to look forward to. We get to the very end, and so basically this movie didn't make much sense at all. You have a slightly unrealistic villain that is more of a quick drawing type, we get to see a supposed good point in the past of this bad guy, he gets killed, but maybe he should've been? and then it's really down hill from there, we get this message in the background, and at the end of the movie it all makes sense, all the characters end up happy, this kind of ending would be good in a script or at least in a movie, but this didn't come together at all.

"There are a lot of pretentious people out there who say these films are about how we should live our lives. But I don't believe that at all. In fact, I feel that if you go into the movies thinking it's about one thing, it is in fact about no one, except (probably) your most fervent opponent. Not to mention that people who speak eloquently about how they want to live their lives still tend to live at the bottom of the ""trendiest"" socioeconomic levels, and it's an entirely different level from that of the romantics.<br /><br />Kids want to play - but they will pay for it later on. Boy bands need the same things that rock bands needed (buy band merch, sell records and tour) - a first album with decent marketing, a big enough market for merch, and money to pay the bands' other expenses (lots of money for paying for computer equipment, phones and gas and traveling to tour, etc.) - when they eventually follow in the footsteps of rock music.

STUDIO 666 (aka THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another movie directed by Alexander Starewicz and written by him. The film follows Michael, a young man who joins a free college of investigation and is helping to investigate the disappearances of a young woman. The police attempt to track down the perpetrator and Alex becomes suspect, while learning that he has a son who may have knowledge about the murders. After one son is killed, Alex refuses to believe that he has to follow-up on leads and investigates for his own son's death. The film has been very well produced and acted by Starewicz who also directed THE KNOCKOUT in 2006. Michael wears some brand new clothes and is a person of interest and believable for some reason. Liev Schreiber is great in a supporting role but his name is not even mentioned once and the film gets off to a slow and stony start. There are a lot of wonderful scenes and a nice climax that comes early in the film that will make you believe things will get much better.

In its way, Mister Foe (originally, and more appropriately, titled THE HELLFIRE) is a cult classic. It's not the best horror movie of all time, but it's not nearly as bad as the majority of low-budget thrash. There's a long, dedicated fan base and a rabid following who haven't had much luck getting their hands on it in recent years. Honestly, they're probably really bitter about the fact that no-name Hollywood talent like Sam Raimi or Mick Garris were really behind the production, as the film has now been out for over twenty years. The cast, thankfully, always managed to land some really quality work (ranging from okay to really great) in the book. Sam Raimi was apparently very reluctant to cast anyone at all, and although none of the other cast members have been mentioned previously, they seem to have an affinity for the kids and the screamin' horror audience. Not only is this classic one of the most positively-named films of all time (the only one that even comes close to it), it's also one of the most profoundly disturbing in the film's canon. No matter how tired I am of SAW or the others, I've always found Horror House to be a lot scarier and scarier than pretty much any other horror film out ther	0	1
I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I ordered this DVD through Amazon.com. I think that this was the best thing that anyone has ever done for me as I do have a severe interest in reading about real people and real lives. And I do not like extreme gross out movies, films that shock me and I find offensive to my sensibilities. This movie does not fit anywhere into any of those categories. It is not funny at all. It is very slow and tiring and dull. Very boring. I would love to see a similar movie by the same writer. Also, I do not like gore in movies and will not watch a horror movie just because there is blood. This is a very moving film that explores how serious things can get if we try and make them a little bit entertaining.<br /><br />I wanted this to be my first movie, so I was eager to see if it was going to be good. I came away from this movie with one of the most mixed emotions I have ever had. This was one of the most enjoyable and moving movies I have ever seen.

...may seem like an overstatement, but it is not.<br /><br />Leslie Howard is a great actor. He has been in and out of roles, but he is one of the most gifted in film and he does it well. This film (as well as C.G.I.L. ) was directed by Richard Dreyfuss. His first film was Love Actually (1964), which was another fine vehicle for his talent and flair. His second film is The Human Centipede (1966), which is a less successful (though also very talented) film. Richard Dreyfuss's third and fourth films were mostly awful. There is no doubt that Howard has developed his craft as a great actor, but this movie just kills my patience. Not only does it have very few of his charm or humor, it is so often repetitive that I find myself feeling very unimpressed, almost bored, by it. And there is no doubt that Howard himself is very annoying. For a director as heavy as Dreyfuss' he has already gone on to become a great director of such bad films as High Noon (1969) and The Magnificent Seven (1977). This is another reason to stay away from this movie. Howard is not funny, he is not deep, he is just very boring. Just for what i	1	0
"This film was more effective in persuading me of a criminal mastermind than any of the other works on the list. In ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" it was supposedly the subplot of an evil slaver from beyond the grave that caught the eye of a man that takes too many drugs, beats his wife and eventually stumbles upon an ancient manuscript. In this film, we learn that he's actually the imprisoned African-American genius Yehuda Bauer, who's been the subject of blackmail by greedy corporate tycoons for the last few hundred years. The plan seems to work out just fine in the end, but his personality is revealed to be more frightening than anything else in the film, and the final sequence could hardly have been made better. Still, there are some instances of the plot sticking around and reoccurring, and when John Cusack's directorial debut is the sole directorial highlight of the film, you know you have something truly special in store. As a tough-as-nails criminal, the characters in this film are so unbelievable, you don't know if they're real or not. In fact, ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" was actually one of the best superhero movies of all time, so I can see why some critics like it and others don't"	0	1
"I went to a small advance screening of this movie at IMDb's online film critic's competition. It was the first time I ever got to see an uncut version of this film in all it's subtitled glory. It was a wonderful experience, the best part was when the right reel came over and said, ""NEW FILM ALONE!"" then they started screening scenes from it in slow motion for all to see. Oh, how I wish I had to. I give this film eight out of ten stars and I think I get my money's worth every time I watch it. It is brilliantly directed and acted by John Cassavetes. While working on his film ""American Graffiti"" he got to observe some really weird scenes in front of people from the audience, the songs coming off of the record were just great and inspired. <br /><br />I was disappointed that the picture didn't come out on DVD as a bonus feature. This film is long, hard to find and they apparently didn't have any money for it. I suspect the reason is that the film was supposed to be the story of Richard Nixon's presidency but due to its length, poor distribution, and poor production values it just ends up being just a short tour-de-force from Cassavetes.

Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, uses flashbacks and shadows to tell a story that is almost too easy to believe. Unfortunately, this one is also quite bad, if that's any indication. It's so bad that it's easy to feel the need to dismiss it as a gimmick. Still, it is worth watching if you're a fan of basic sleaze.<br /><br />Watching the film would probably be enough to make you think that, for example, by flipping the story in the direction of the main character in the first two sequences, Preminger is telling a flashback in which we see his father, played by Jeffrey Wright, killing his mother in a very early scene. Or imagine he's telling us that one in which his character makes a one-liner comment about the fact that he's facing unemployment, when it's clear the truth is, well, that he's not well off. Or imagine a flashback showing us what Preminger and Keaton are talking about while they're in their room at the Flats--a room that's so bad that if you really put your mind to it, you might suspect that Preminger's parents, played by Jeff Goldblum and Andrew Hamilton, are just suffering from a sleeping disorder.<br /><br />The movie als	1	0
Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A teller in a bank, he earns enough money to pay for a nice house in New York, but then decides to stay in the city because he can't get out. He finally gets out of it and moves to Paris, but the monotony of the place steals him away from his new friends and family. Then, he meets Estelle (Natalija Chikatilo), a woman who loves him for his money and his bad-ass attitude.<br /><br />It's a difficult story to tell. The real tragedy in Mallet's life is the unwillingness of his father to let him go to school and thus destroy his chances of finding a good job. As for Natalija, she's probably the least threatening character in the entire movie and plays her part in a way that adds nothing. She needs to have a bigger part, because she's just too great to care about the lack of acting.<br /><br />A truly terrible film that should never have been made. 	1	0
"1999 will go down in history as the year the rule changed for boys to be expected to stand for the national anthem. In America they have always been expected to kneel. To ""respect"" the flag. To play ""good sports"" or ""play a game"". To just ""act patriotic"". Then came N'Sync and along came Rock. They decided that they wanted us to believe that there was something wrong with us if we did not stand for the anthem. I can understand why they chose to do it. They are now in the National Football League. Why? Because they like to stand and smack their fist on the table for the camera. Why didn't they stand for the national anthem in the Baywatch remake that came out last year? Well I guess that was a ""feature"". Either way, I would have been offended if the Rock Band 4 had that rule. "	0	1

"I've had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for more than half my life. I first saw the famous 4.2 HURT ON EARTH movie in the late 1960s, which I saw with my parents. As a boy, I was terrified of them, and only stopped being scared of them when my dad saw a scary cartoon about them on the TV for Christmas. By 1978, I had heard that most tornadoes were 70 mph, but I had never actually seen a large one.<br /><br />The movie I saw in 1980 was also a good movie, especially about how you could be bitten by a tornado and still live.

I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to write something positive about it. I know it is from the past, and there are so many issues that have gone unaddressed, but it is still the best science fiction movie I have seen in a very long time. The entire story revolves around these fantastic creatures, so naturally you also start to question how these creatures actually behaved and influenced man on an ethical level. The creature designs and voices are different (and this, in itself is an homage to the old Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition), but Grendel is still just as creative and interesting as any other creepy horror movie that we have come to know and love over the last decade or so. Not only does it have some of the strongest sci fi creature design of any recent film in terms of supporting creatures, but the creatures are not weak at all. They are powerful and deadly. They are brilliant killers. As always, they are dynamic in their movements and threaten to attack a moment's notice. The fight sequences in Grendel are very good and very exciting. It is obvious that if they could create a creature that was similar to a normal bat, they could almost recreate the entire mechanical race of bat-men for example. Their attacks are almost reminiscent of those i	0	1

I have yet to read a negative professional review of this flick and can't help but feel that I've just seen the best effort ever by an executive producer/director. The plot of this film is based on the various urban legends surrounding a fake drug 'K2' which was created to numb the senses and prevent the soldiers from losing their concentration. But what makes this movie enjoyable is that it shows you how these characters are connected from the beginning to the end. It is a joyous film filled with good hearted drama, fun and music. This is a classic that deserves to be seen by a broader audience and may well do so. 7/10 	0	1
"Though the movie may have been ""true"" to Lewis's book, its tragic conclusion was one of the most painful I have ever seen. To die an unhappy and isolated life being completely alone was a profound loss. We were sent to see this movie to experience the pain, and not get it. "	0	1
I know the film snobs are snorting. But if you're going to spend three hours and more on a film that you don't know anything about, than you should at least know the crew, which is the case with this film. You don't need to have a Ph.D. to do well in film school to be good at this thing. A small aspect of the film involves meeting people for coffee in dark bars, and often drinking a latte and watching the music, and while watching I laughed at a few things.

"I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love bad comedies and I think that this one is just as bad. The acting was so bad and the script just didn't make any sense. I'm not sure if it was time to walk out of the theater or if I was in denial for even watching it, but it didn't feel so good after about 20 minutes.<br /><br />My favorite part of this movie is when Cpl. Sam does a run through some mountains while someone is building a cave. It's so funny and I can't believe how bad it is. I laughed so hard it hurt. But of course the horrible dialog came back and ""guess who I am now?"".<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this. Not worth watching and I just want to know why those on here gave it a 1 because I was disappointed in the acting and the script. I really wanted to give this a 3 because of the ""bad"" writing but that wasn't the case. I thought it was so stupid, I really didn't want to continue to watch it. "	1	0
Okay - I'll confess. This is the movie that made me rethink how much I love my self-made kids. It's the movie that will probably make you feel angry that you spent an hour and a half for two hours of your life. You may not be the parent you think you are.<br /><br />At first it may seem a little unfair that you spent 90 minutes and $8 to watch this if you already bought the DVD. But if you look at the extremely constructive comments posted on the message board that I found the comments very funny, and provided you check out the direct comments, many of them give exactly the same comment as the ones posted here.<br /><br />I am so glad someone else wrote this movie. If you watch this and find a part that bothers you, that is your business. Don't be afraid to ask for a refund, and tell your local Wal-Mart or Target or Walgreens department store you've paid to see a movie that you probably didn't even want. It's much better to not spend a single cent on a movie that may not be up to your expectations. I love movies like this that don't treat their subject matter like an insult to you.<br /><br />Even if it makes you angry at the amount of money that went int	1	0
"The 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" has been one of my favourites ever since I first saw it on video in the early 80s. Although the 1990s version is badly done, it is still one of my favourite horror films of all time. All the special effects in this film are great, although I believe they could of used some credit for using a better camera - I believe John Carpenter used the image from ""The Haunting"" almost all of the time in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and it was done in a way that made it look as though the ghost was actually there. I suppose he should have paid more attention to this than his contemporaries because his movies are kind of a big deal when they aren't gold - even if they aren't truly great.<br /><br />But the really bad thing about this movie is that it is only a terrible thing, because it is such a big deal that you don't have to waste your time watching it.

The world is made up two different types of moviegoers...those who watch movies and those who don't. For me, the world is mostly the movie. I think everyone has a movie to watch to some extent. However, for me, the movie is the one I watch most. The only downside of this movie is the acting is somewhat weak and the flow of the movie isn't really clear. However, if you are a fan of the genre, you should see this. 	1	0
"Airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane en route from Hong Kong to New York. Thoroughly impressed with the airplane's design and performance, it takes off and lands in Los Angeles, where it's changed hands again and is registered to a clique of wealthy land-lopers and jetshow hosts, played by Gary Cooper and Ed Begley Jr. David Morse (Cooper) is trying to make a fast buck in America, by flying the 747, and working his way through the big game show circuit, which is even more exclusive and enthralling than what he's doing. Morse's plane comes under attack by a madman who intends to crash it into the ground, and he has to improvise and operate all the controls while competing against the likes of a buddy terrorist named Dick ""Mongol"" Wong (Daniels). For a couple of years after the event, Morse is pretty good at flying the plane and pretending to be piloting it, but by the end of the film, the plane is covered in water, having been shot down and it's time for him to make his big bucks. His lawyer explains that the airline has to send him a check for about $200,000, and Morse has to cash in the plane when it flies off the land into the ocean"	0	1
"While I don't claim to be any sort of expert on Hitchcock (with the exception of ""Speak Easily,"" for which I served as director and co-producer, but I'm not a Hitchcock fan), I do know what to expect from a very good Hitchcock movie. The only similarity I can think of to this movie is that it is far better written and acted.<br /><br />First of all, there are more dialogs in this movie than the first four installments of Hitchcock's ""Scarecrow"" series. This could be a good thing, since not every line was in Hitchcock's script. However, ""The Birds"" appears to have no dialogue for about the first three or four minutes.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, the plot of a killer rabbit stalking an American family is very much alive and well. However, it is kept in a mystery for the entire movie, as not even the witnesses to the killings can figure out who is the killer. The killer's obsession with the little girl is written so well in this film that it's very hard to figure out what the killer is trying to accomplish by stalking her. All you can say is, ""Whoa, what the heck is he trying to accomplish?""<br /><br />In one particular scene, as th"	0	1
"For months preceding the release of this movie you saw word everywhere that this was the real deal. And not just any bad movie. Like, there was an email explaining that I should ""snore"" if I saw this movie. How do you know that? You didn't. And the distributors did too. There is only one scene in this movie that really shocked me and made me laugh. For some reason I had to watch this at least 15 times just to get a good laugh.<br /><br />The biggest thing I can say about this movie is that it feels like it was created in 1996. At least that's how I felt about this movie after watching it. It's a good looking movie that kinda reminded me of Full House (which was released the same year) but nothing spectacular. I also think I would probably agree that this movie is 'dumb' to think that a male star can make the effort to grow a mustache.<br /><br />7/10 "	0	1
i like Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Towers and Death of a Salesman. I've read all the books by Emma, though. The story behind it is interesting, if not new. It will make you think about the truth of the time. As with other books, Emma will doubt herself and the benefit she might have gained. An idealistic young girl obsessed with fashion and beauty and sleeping with as many men as she can - it all makes you go a little dizzy.<br /><br />I don't know what they were thinking when they picked Jane Austin. She is charming, innocent and cute. She is actually good looking - though no where near as good as in her books. Anyway, she does fall for Andrew around the same time as the man she hoped she could be. It is the marriage which is out of this world, even for a Pride and Prejudice book. She makes him happy, when she could have hurt him. I didn't like her getting dragged into the much larger love affair with her family's man. It was a little different from their original family life, which was almost totally platonic. <br /><br />In fact, her husband has married his friends - and it makes you feel sorry for him because he was just happy to have foun	0	1
This is probably one of Brian De Palma's best known films because it has been most popularly compared to his 'Dr. Strangelove' but is just as enjoyable. The plot is simple; a Russian scientist (John Cassavetes) brings his young and beautiful daughter from her parents' graves in Miami to live in New York where she meets a rich guy (Philip Seymour Hoffman). She falls in love with him and helps him in some of his experiments. As a result of these activities she becomes a total nutcase, has a woman crush on the young boyfriend of her husband (John Cleese), and starts seeing someone very strange. What could possibly happen next? You could say the same for this film as anything could happen and because of this it could actually be good!<br /><br />The film is about three unlikely but ultimately touching characters; a dumb-dumb college girl (played by Susan Hayward), a confused, lonely divorced woman (Rosalind Russell), and a lonely old scientist (Clive Owen). Of course, in order to make it more interesting, you could look at the events of this film as something unique but I'm here to tell you, it's not a movie that holds your attention because of the substance. The plot just barely registers and for the most part it jus	1	0
Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I mean REALLY WORSE. this was the biggest failure of the company. it should never have made it to air or at least never have made it to video. its all right with me. how can you be a fan of this character. DON'T BUY THE MOVIE. This movie is just plain awful. Just pathetic. How can this person give this little cult film such a bad review. If you get a chance see this movie before you think you can never get the real thing. It is a pity that someone put this into production,because as far as i am concerned,You will hate this movie more than you'll like the real thing. This movie has nothing to recommend it to and i hope that no-one sees this movie and has the same misgivings. This movie is like a dump of a movie. I give it a 3 out of 10. 	1	0
There's a lot the matter with Helen and none of it worth worrying about. It's not about the poor love interest, it's about a sick man that no amount of love can turn back. The director may have put it into the right frame of mind, but it still doesn't do Helen any justice. That in itself doesn't make this a bad movie. It has charm and style, but it doesn't do it enough to make this a good movie. The MST3K version puts it in a really bad light. 	0	1
The Good Thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and provocative. There is a lot of passion in the performance of the main characters as they struggle to deal with life and are thrown from family to family. In some ways the movie seemed to come from a time and place where there was a stigma against gays and lesbians, which might explain its timing. This movie makes it easy for young people to understand and embrace their families. <br /><br />The Bad Thing about this movie: The pacing is a little slow and the characters are not fully developed. The performances are awkward and underdeveloped. I suppose that if you're going to do a movie like this you might as well make the best of an awkward situation.<br /><br />Overall: See this movie if:<br /><br />1) You are gay or a lesbian 2) You are comfortable with a gay or lesbian cast 3) You want to make your own movies <br /><br />* out of the horrible movie theater experience 	1	0
"Watching CBS's ""Surrender, Dorothy"", I kept wondering why Diane Keaton has lasted so long in the business. She's long since done that. Just recently, she did a role which was so silly, so sad, it was funny. That was her first film. It's as if she said, ""Give me another stupid role"" and looked around for someone to take her place. Oh dear. These days, she must have an easier time picking on girls in her position. But, I digress. Diane Keaton is in this, and I don't think I can fault her at all. In her other performances, she has shown that she is able to shock without falling too far into the level of the film. She handles her role like some sort of substance in this. She is a theater comedian who doesn't get to do it until much later in life. <br /><br />But, when she is not implausibly screwing people over, she doesn't really have much of a script. Maybe it's a slow day and there's not much to work with, but I think she did have a film to work with. When she finds ""security"" in finally finding a job and being able to keep living the life she had before her body was ripped apart by tragedy, it's fine. She neve"	0	1
"I did not see this film in the theater. I went into it knowing it was a bad movie, but I have to say that when the actors were all there it was as good as it could be. It was my friend's movie, but I had a good time watching it. I enjoyed it enough to watch the movie again and again and I think it would have made better film if it had been shown on the big screen like the movies I just mentioned. The ""revenge plot"" seemed so contrived in that in the end he didn't do it because he loved her and he didn't regret it at all. It just didn't make sense at all. He would have been a much better choice for Valentine if it had made any sense at all. I really can't recommend this movie for any other reason. "	1	0
"I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to take any nude scenes off the film, they cut from her entire performance. ""Can't you see that you're ruining the film?"" I thought to myself. But no, they won't be changing the film! The perfect ending of the story begins with Kay Francis moving to California with her parents and the film moves along and eventually settles into an audience with me as I'm trying to finish the film. The film is also, of course, full of shock-y moments and the film is very funny in the way it goes along with the story. I thoroughly recommend this film for those who can appreciate the mature humor and weirdness of the story, and for those who appreciate something different from classic films such as Harry Potter.

I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception.<br /><br />The title is very funny. The story has James, too, as a kindly old man who is suddenly reduced to helping the rich and famous by buying his children to go to the homes of the poor. Poor children...Why they are poor is never explained but the poor children don't appear poor but simply mean well to everyone and are well cared for. Then the master's son is a great genius...But Henry James is the best thing to happen to this film. A great humor to enjoy as we get to know Henry James well as we understand his life and his invention.<br /><br />I have re-read his autobiography A River Runs Through It (2008) on the internet, in French (sort of) and I can't stop laughing, because this is so very funny, the funny side of James and the sharp humanity of his characters, making them real but making us forget the silly side. While we laugh we also get to know him and we get to know that he is a very nice old man with a heart. When that happens you laugh too. We get to know him, we care for him and we cheer for him.<br /><br />My sister gave me the DVD and has had it fo	0	1
I work at a Blockbuster store and every week we get bored with these bad movies. This one is about a girl that has just gotten a baby and has to decide if she wants to stay with the parents or find a better place to live. It's a good movie with a good story line and cool songs. I saw this movie at our local Blockbuster this past weekend so I must say that I give it a 7 out of 10. The reason for that is, the acting wasn't horrible. I don't think the characters are all that bad, and some of them just looked like they were bored of them for awhile. But the kids are OK too. There are 3 young children in the movie. They cry and laugh at times. There are no awkward moments for the three kids because there are so many of them. One boy, Lee (Shaun Seder), I thought was a bit annoying. He'd come up and do everything except talk to his mom (Catherine Zeta Jones) because he was a bit too chatty. The girl, Sabrina (Jodie Sweetin), is way too annoying. She makes Lee laugh and needs to be separated from the three kids. There are some annoying characters in this movie. Teri (Nicole Kidman) is not too bad and ver	0	1
"It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be. At first the general idea was that it was ""an American horror classic"" but it has all of the old clichés that have been put in place for years: People are threatened, at a certain point they think they are dying. Think about it! Then there's the killer, who looks very much like Freddy Krueger and has no skin, he takes away the humanity of the victims, he pokes holes through their necks. The story is pretty much the same and we get a great villainy too. You can really see Freddy (Robert Englund) getting his revenge on those kids who beat him up a long time ago. And some gruesome scenes where they tie up people for hours at a time!<br /><br />The thing is, even though the movie does have some of the same trappings that you've seen in other horror movies, it is far superior to them and is far more satisfying. The dialogue is painfully dry, the acting is wooden, the special effects are simple and almost unimpressive. And for the most part it's really poorly acted too. No one is funny.

"My wife and I are semi amused by Howie Mandel's appearance here as God. He is not very good as the King, he doesn't have much of a command over the character and the plot is not very interesting. He does his best, if that is the right word. He has a cameo as Jack Nicholson's ex-girlfriend on ""Death of a Salesman,"" which seemed very inappropriate for this film. But the best performance here is Mr. Safran Foer, he does very well portraying the person who can best do what is asked of him. Foe is rated PG. "	0	1
Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors. I'm really tempted to rate this one a 4 or 5. It's a really fairly dull and boring film. It certainly has the element of comedy to it. And you can tell that Fuller is trying to go for a dark comedy and he does succeed in doing so. I give this film a 6. 	1	0
I really didn't expect much from this film seeing as it stars Joel Schumacher, but it was really well put together. There were a lot of big names involved in the production, who had a lot of experience and common sense in the writing and directing. The script had a lot of cliché's like family living in an uncomfortable situation, crime, etc. There are big scares along the way and you'll see the future on screen. At one point I was getting a little scared thinking that maybe this was all a dream, but I was wrong. I was expecting a thriller with some real scares, instead I got a wonderful film with a top notch script that kept me wondering about the next 10 minutes. It would probably have made for a great horror film if they had given a more grounded interpretation of it, but I just found it disturbing, instead I just thought the script was a waste of my time. I really felt like I should be preparing myself for the hell of it, because I have seen some horror films I have enjoyed, but this was one that I just didn't like. The ending was very disturbing to me and I'll probably watch this one again in a couple of years. 10/10 	0	1
"For the big thinkers among us, ""The Intruder"" is a shock film which holds up very well in many ways. It's a fun movie which is unfilmable; however, I really do feel that the director over acted in this film. The plot is disjointed and feels like a prelude to something else; the acting is hardly up to the standard set by his earlier comedies and the plot can feel very disjointed at times. The final laugh I think, is put forth by Chevy Chase, but I'm not sure that's what it is. Though a entertaining movie, I found the pacing of this film very slow and I never got too emotionally attached to any of the characters, as I don't necessarily care about them much. With all that said, ""The Intruder"" is a good idea. The comedy takes a bit off to get the viewer to ""get it"" (more on that later), but this is still worth it. On a negative, not so good movie. Not too great, but not bad either. "	0	1
"An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is treated unfairly by his previous self-appointed guardian, who after most of the movie treats the boy like a dog (and is therefore a dog in the eyes of this boy). This movie is something of a ""geek's treat"" inasmuch as it doesn't leave one holding the binoculars or wearing the headphones.<br /><br />Not only is the kid utterly preposterous, but the whole of the movie resembles a tabloid view of the world. ""This is all part of a big conspiracy to frighten people and keep us addicted to alcohol and drugs."" <br /><br />However, this ""code"" of ""not dealing with retarded people"" still serves to retain an irrational hatred of human life, something really unattractive.

"Here's a decent mid-70's horror flick about a gate of hell closing that god-forsaken place. You know, the one where Adam and Eve were killed and Eve was left with a horrible scar. She then tried to create a copy of herself to make a new body for herself. The filmmaker wanted us to believe the creature made her way back to Earth and passed by Earthlings all over the place. Great stuff, but then again, there's more that's just a lot of cheesy stuff shoved in. The film really is not that good. It's not scary, isn't funny, isn't witty, isn't entertaining, isn't sexy, isn't creepy, isn't disturbing, and is just plain boring.<br /><br />Some people actually liked it. I was wondering why because it's a really low-budget flick, but then it hit me that the other reviewers had all taken their money on this low-budget. First off, it had a French-language title, which was annoying. The other reason I noticed it was a French-language title was because the director seems to have had it in his head that many French films are similarly miscast in order to show off his skills as a filmmaker. It actually kind of worked. ""City of Fear"", ""Inventive"", ""Ca"	1	0
I saw Heartland when it was first released in 1980. Before then I had only seen and heard of what I think is the worst comedy of all time, Seinfeld. I believe I saw it in about 11 days. It was bad, but for the time. For its time. I remembered not liking its attitude, but now that I've seen it over 20 times I realize its cheap and shallow. Now that I think about it, many of the older versions of a Seinfeld gag or parody do a good job of it. (The George Carlin skit is excellent.) But I still can't stand this version of it. I really like Michael Douglas and Chris Sarandon. I have to say that they deserve better roles than they get in this movie. I'm a Seinfeld die hard and I will say that I wish these people would stay on Seinfeld for a long time. 	1	0

This movie never once crossed our minds that ""they"" were anything but the jerks and thugs we were led to believe. I mean come on!!! You can't act like a normal person in this movie! I remember one scene where they were shooting a revolver on the truck that was carrying the bodies. Just unbelievable!!! How could this happen? I had to sit through nearly two hours of this movie because I couldn't take any of the jerky editing and droning to the finish line! But again, that is only me!

Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. A journey on the freeway led by a young man with an idea to help his family.

"Ben Masters,(Kyd Thomas),""Dream Lover"",'86 plays a sort of Mike Hammer mannered piano player and very different from his later performance in ""The Blue Lagoon"" at the age of 73. In this very successful film, Masters isn't even seen as the lead character, he is the supporting cast. He is handsome and energetic with an alluring smile and his signature at the piano is ""Happy Piano"". His father (William Brent Masters) is very uptight about his son's performance of a great piano composition. Brent Masters is a real musical genie, he never allows his son to play piano but rather (over)limits his son's musical talent to the extent that after Brent Masters dies of a heart attack, the young Ben Masters rejects his son's piano playing (well now we all know the ""Heart Break Kid"" is a big deal, i guess) and tries to keep the pieces of the piano with his wife (Karen Allen). One day, young Billy sends Kyd a picture of his father and asks her if she can ""discuss how he can get those frets out of the keys.""

Some of those guys that watch films and complain about them somehow seems to have so much self respect that they don't even pay attention to the actual film. This movie is the opposite. This movie is about what being a college student should be like. It is a movie about people that you wish were making films and of course if you have ever had the misfortune of having your aspirations dashed by this society's obsession with big name actors then you know what I'm talking about. The movie touches on topics that you would think would be rather easy to handle with a few poorly written dialogs and a cast of clueless individuals that seem to have no social skills at all.<br /><br />I have to say that this movie had my attention all the way through and there is never a time where it stops. I can't say that this movie is original because it was a clone of a movie that I already knew. This movie is just just a bunch of characters that talk in complete and utter nonsense.

Wow, i'm a huge Henry VIII/Tudor era fan and, well, i figured i'd give it a try. The movie is very good, though i have to say that the wardrobe and make up is pretty flat, not that there's anything wrong with that. The film is about two teenagers in the first Tudor era who end up becoming lovers with each other, but only after they jump ship from their respective houses. Oh, and it makes absolutely no sense. This whole story is, in its simplest form, about a young woman going to work in a castle and on the way there meets and falls in love with Prince Henry VIII of England. So, yes, some silly bits do happen, but the rest of the movie is superbly acted and manages to achieve an immense amount of tension, and pure nudity.<br /><br />The actors play the leads perfectly, with the exception of a couple of the supporting characters, who need to be filled in more quickly. When someone from the other house changes the ending, i found it a bit strange and i like to watch a lot of Shakespeare, but this movie just didn't make it feel like it did (although the ending was no doubt appropriate, as all of the reasons for Henry's death make no sense).<br /><br />In short, i am highly disappointe	0	1
79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers never made anything but rock songs together in this film, and they were never again in a film together until the dramatic series SINGLE CUTS, when they were either very close or very far apart. One of the only times they ever went more than twenty minutes apart was in a musical together in THE KING'S MEN and not only did they never get together again (which is not impossible), but what the hell was it with a 50's flick with Shirley Temple? It's even not good. It's just a big disappointment. Very loud and very boring, Astaire's tone with his guitar and Rogers' singing style are alternately light and hard, and that's about all you get to hear. Astaire takes some time off, and Ginger Rogers spends most of the film with the singer whose car she stopped in as a token of their friendship. The happy ending is done so badly that it is sadder than anything Astaire did, but it is extremely unlikely (let alone a plus) for this story. Still, it's not a bad film and it's not one of Astaire's worst either. 	1	0
To be honest at the time i first heard of this movie i thought it was a bad movie. But its not. It was funny, even if it was predictable. The acting is average in the cast. You would think that people that don't like the rest of the cast would be rooting for Matthew Perry in the movie. But they aren't. There are some funny jokes that come out of this movie. The story line isn't bad. In fact the story of the movie takes it way too far. The script is still very good and from the first scene of it all you can tell the storyline is going to get better and better. The actors aren't bad either. Mr. Pabst is always amusing in his roles and his scenes with Candy Johnson (who I have seen several times before) are very funny. Jason Schwartzman is extremely funny and the supporting cast of Victor Garber, Oliver Stone, Sinatra, Paresh Rawal, Fred Astaire, and Dick Powell (who has appeared in all the Frank Capra movies) are awesome. The music is also very good and by no means must be recognized. But no movie comes close to this one in terms of acting and quality of writing. Still I would recommend you to watch it.

After watching some of HBO's great stuff - Band of Brothers and Grey Gardens, I was quite curious to see if this was the same studio. While I have to admit I was disappointed, I could not pass up the chance to see this on DVD. The only big flaw is that the very trailer you see has some of the footage missing. However, it only applies to the Trailer that was shown at the DVD release. I understand they have put in the missing scenes. 	0	1
That is no criticism of the film, but rather a criticism that people don't think of it as a movie. It is a narrative novel, so it's not supposed to be seen that way. The problems with it are twofold: the script and the main character. First, the screenwriters seem to think that a train wreck will happen when a girl falls into a gorge without planning it for any reason other than to make you mad. Of course, this is not a great idea since it renders the story inconsequential, not to mention boring. The real tragedy is that this girl is such a lousy train wreck that she cannot stop herself from walking down that precipitous cliff. She is a child, not in terms of intelligence or curiosity, but in terms of her nervous/demented instability. The last thing on the train wreck is that she has to be rescued, in case her near death experience as a young girl left her to die alone in the wilderness. So, she has to jump off that cliff, in case it comes to that. Why? Well, we have to understand that this was a screenwriter's idea to begin with and that they did not consider it a serious piece of writing to end like that. Who said that such a thing could ever happen in the real world? The script als	1	0
Some war movies succeed where others do not, and that's precisely where this pretty good one falls short. You get the sense that many actors in this film were working hard to get their paychecks. The characters are fairly familiar to most movie goers, and the story does allow for the open mindedness that comes with a couple of episodes of Full House. However, it doesn't try very hard to make up for the major shortcomings with the acting. In fact, I was under the impression that Christopher Lloyd and Romy Schneider were about to get together and have a bunch of slapstick fun, but the screenplay didn't allow it. After the initial opening credits were completed, you just don't get a lot of reaction until you move into the next episode. Also, the plot of the movie leaves quite a lot to the imagination, because after a great deal of thought, they just can't seem to figure out who is being targeted (with a possibility for one or both of the new leads to be Jane and Sophia).<br /><br />The second half of the movie is the most interesting and probably the most controversial. First, we see Jane meeting with Lincoln and his sister at a park. As some others have commented, it seems to be very much a mystery what happens next. They end up at the far	1	0
I saw this movie when it came out when I was nine years old. I have since seen it many times. I will probably watch it again and again. However, I'm not sure if I am going to see it again or not. I also have a feeling that for all the marvelous plot twists and fantastic special effects that go on with the movie, this movie does NOT answer any of the questions that we have as humans when it comes to time travel. It is a 90 minute movie filled with all of the usual cliches of 'Oh, I wish I'd known this when I was younger.' That may have been my main issue with this movie: there are so many cliches to this movie.<br /><br />However, there are so many more. Some people love this movie. I also like this movie, but not in the way they would like me to like it. I think it's great that the writers tried to give these little kids a chance to see something they normally wouldn't, but it doesn't work. However, I also think the director could have done a lot more to explain the basic concepts and concepts of time travel. Not only is it obvious that time travel is impossible, but there is so much they can only possibly explain through all of the magic of TV show	1	0
I guess it's Jack's great empathic ability that makes him such an addict to people. He can read their minds. We all do it sometimes, just not as much as he. However, there's a problem in his family. His brother, Warren, is a little edgey. He's addicted to heroin and gets a fair amount of attention from the police in order to bring Warren down. What Jack doesn't know is that Warren really is sick. He has a huge, probably fatal needle stuck through his head. He has a secret. He has an old, wheelchair-bound brother with a massive, throbbing wound on his arm. He has a teenager girlfriend who gets serious about money, and a young white guy whose memory has been corrupted by drugs. Jack wants to help, and everything starts falling into place. He has a crack dealer, his uncle, and a spiritualist, who help him turn over a new leaf. <br /><br />There are a lot of dramatic turns, great acting from all the main characters, and an interesting subplot. It's not a great film. It's not even a crime film. But this guy is always doing good things in a different form. And if you watch with an open mind, you will be hooked from the beginning. 	0	1
I watched Peter Jackson version of Lord of the Rings as soon as it came out. I didn't think it was that great as far as Lord of the Rings films go, but I thought it was better than this one. It had a lot of good things, like good cast, and surprisingly good scripts. But, this film did not live up to its reputation. Some jokes were stupid, some parts were stupid, and some scenes were badly written. But, I was one of those people who loved the original books and the books are my favorite movie, not just this film. And, it is kinda sad that some people think it is better to remake movies than not do it at all, it is just sad.<br /><br />Even though my rating is only a 1/10 (but I like it. I saw all the episodes now, and the movies are in several languages, so that is good), I still consider the Lord of the Rings trilogy the best, even though I felt it wasn't that good. I give it a 3 out of 10. 	0	1

I picked this one up because the music was done by Moe Davidson and I like he. He's also the guy who did JAWS and was in The Pursuit of Happiness. So I was excited to see it and it didn't disappoint. The only thing that disappointed me was the nudity. First off, the visuals were beautiful. There was some animation but it wasn't terrible. The acting was okay and the sound was okay. There was the typical story and a few surprises.<br /><br />The movie is about a love triangle that is about to happen between two guys. There is plenty of nude scenes with no nudity. There is only two scenes with nudity. <br /><br />As usual in films this isn't always an issue but in this one, there were quite a few. The best one was probably the scene where the mother of the two was naked in the bedroom in the beginning of the movie. I understand why this would get a bad review but that's how it worked in the first place. There was a lot of little things that could have been better.<br /><br />Overall, it was okay but I thought it was maybe a little too explicit and very disturbing. Only one thing really stood out for me. There are four nude scenes in the movie. To m	0	1
"Really, I think this movie is more an example of how fascism doesn't work. It's about the actual development of the situation and isn't really about ""How bad it is"". The basic conditions of existence for people on the bottom are as beautiful as the people on the top. It is unfortunate that today this situation and similar situations can't be released on film or even broadcast.<br /><br />Some people have called this movie a propaganda film. This is not a good idea since it undermines the very idea of making a film. It's about the real facts of existence and no one should be swayed by propaganda. For some reason, people who criticise this movie think that by making a film of it they undermine the violent principles that were expressed in it. I'm not a Marxist but even he can't take that case seriously.<br /><br />I understand the need for people to talk about the situation on the lower social strata but it's difficult to understand the failure of the capitalist system when they not only keep all of the women in marriages, but also consensually practice rape and sell their bodies to rich men in order to survive. There's a huge gap in the definition of exploitation when it isn't about turning a profit but is by definition helping people survive. It's completely without merit whe"	1	0
Personally, I enjoyed Cut thouroughly. It was the first time I liked any Frank Miller film, and I am really glad I did. To give a positive review of an inferior film, one that just doesn't live up to it's hopes and expectations, is an act of selfishness. It is disrespectful to others who may be searching for something more significant, or interesting to experience in cinema. After several comments on my personal review, one poster said that he would never see it, and he ended up renting it, and has never seen it. The idea and the story could have worked if this had been a thriller, but at least it would have been different than Catwoman. There is no way the story with Zapp Brannigan's Bruce Wayne could have worked if he had a more memorable mentor than Bruce, and an environment that gives Bruce a chance to develop as a character, in addition to the typical Bruce book and comic book sideshow, along with the usual Alfred. To be honest, I actually felt disappointed with the end of the movie, and the ending of the film for this particular film would have been even better. Even with all of that being said, I would recommend this to someone who has never seen it before, and wants to see something new, different and exciting than any other movie they have seen i	1	0
"I'm really tempted to reward ""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail"" with an 8.5/10, but I think I've turned into a doctor of science: opinionated, intelligent, still thinking, but so increasingly convinced that it's the worst film of the year that I've ever seen.<br /><br />My opinions may not always be 100% accurate, but generally speaking I'm pretty decent about positive or negative reviews and I try to take my own positive, more logical judgement for granted. I know that there's a lot of logic in the world and that logic could always be wrong, which is why I try to give an objective view about films - when I don't like a film, I try not to review it - but there's often no need to, in fact there should be, in order to make sure there's no injustice in the world.<br /><br />When it comes to movie reviews, I have some dubious principles: things that can be inherently excusable - but funny to me, or even entertaining in a fun way, are never given a 10/10. If a film is rated 1/10 by IMDb and you want it to be 10/10, then you probably need to stick to 1/10, because 10 is merely a number. Of course it'"	1	0
A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as it relates to crime. It is an extremely popular movie in Japan, and people tend to watch it for the plots, and there is something about the prison break that people seem to enjoy. However, I have to agree with this person, Shinjuku Triad Society has too many plot holes, and some of the incidents depicted are extremely questionable. For example, the police station scene in which the police officer is shot, and after healing he escapes and is able to walk out of the building is simply not possible. It seems like he was shot in broad daylight in the background. Or, when the boyfriend refuses to leave the bar that the two of them have been dancing at for over an hour, it seems like the shooting of a shotgun goes unnoticed as the two of them are dancing together, but then the shot of the police car flying through the night sky and hitting the girls car just a few moments later is obviously not taken. What's more, it appears that the people who have committed such acts for many years are still around, and are especially active in the streets. Then, there's the interaction between Tatsuhiko Kudoh and Kiyoshi Watanabe, when Tatsuhiko is pushed around by several people in the restaurant, or whe	1	0
This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and Great Plains Natural Area. The rather wild aspect of the film is that is takes place in late summer in the Manitoba Park. All the situations are very realistic. For example, with their skis, the Inuit must choose between going to ski or hiking in an arctic wet area. One of the girls goes to ski rather than hike in an arctic wet area. One is not allowed to go around the block, and there are many dances and other social activities that the girls have to participate in. The fishing is impressive and there is some very colourful waters in the lake. For a film that stars Natalie Wood and Russell Crowe, the film is little good.<br /><br />Let me give some other examples, the musical songs were quite good, and the fight scenes had a lot of energy. I believe the only negative thing I would say is that they should have shown a bit more of the Hudson's Bay. For this place was such an important part of Canada. It was the place where the First Nations first came to settle and where all the Canadian Indian burial grounds were located. Some of the buildings in the park and in the Canadian Olympic Park are beautifully located. What a shame this film is now largely forgotten.<br /><br />Do yoursel	0	1
My personal opinion is that this movie had no real plot whatsoever and there was no real action in it. The whole story is told through the actions of the main characters. The worst part was that the movie could have been much better if the writer had just said a little bit more of the storyline and helped make it a little bit more interesting and had more characters do more things.<br /><br />Now I get that there were a lot of things that were different, I feel sorry for actors who have to work so hard to do this movie. I like actors. My favorite actors in this movie were Michael Rapaport and Benjamin Bratt. Why wasn't there more of them? I would have liked to see more of Michael Rapaport and Benjamin Bratt in a more meaningful scene.<br /><br />The acting was not too bad. It is true that the actor who played Ryan made a big mistake and should have not signed up for this movie. But, his performance is simply too cute and his way of playing Michael was so fun and was so smart. I also feel sorry for the guy who played Jared. He really couldn't play any part of Michael's life and his character was too flat.<br /><br />Anyways, they left out certain things and no matter what this movi	1	0
"I didn't approach ""Still Crazy"" with any real anticipation. Just two beers and I was ready to follow it to the letter. I have no complaints. If you like great filmed music, movies, food, and live acts I'd recommend this film. If you like a good edge and have a good appreciation for musical theater I would recommend this film. If you just want to experience good storytelling with great acting you should definitely check this out. My only gripe is that the film, for some inexplicable reason (and I could be wrong) when the film ended I was being invited to finish it on the spot, knowing that it would end with me left feeling nothing but cheated and robbed. I really had to work for that moment.<br /><br />Some say this film is hard. I must disagree with this. I could have done without some of the jokes. In a perfect world, they would have made me laugh a little more. They have done away with one very important element, which is the humor. Unfortunately, I was left with very little. I felt the entire film was stilted and rather empty. It was completely empty of spirit and excitement. They even take us into a training session that doesn't make sense. In short, I felt that the film simply fell flat. It was incredibly slow and fla"	1	0
The master of movie spectacle Cecil B. De Mille goes off script as often as he does; this is one of his good ones. Unfortunately, this year's version isn't as spectacularly filmed as the earlier one. This could have been a truly masterful (as so often is the case), if technically competent, work of cinema; but instead, it's both dumb and laughable. By the end of it, I was laughing myself sick; and that's not the part of it that made me laugh, it's the part of it that made me want to smack the nearest kid in the face.

"I wasn't alive in the 60's, so I can't guarantee it'll really match up to the original. It's not that I don't remember the 60's, it just doesn't capture the memories that it should. As I'm sure many of you will know, the 60's were a time of revolution and unrest. I remember seeing something like San Francisco's Bond Street on television once or twice a week. San Francisco's name still pops up in my head when I think of the 60's. Movies like ""The Public Enemy"" and ""The Bodyguard"" are classics of this era. The Air France 747 was long gone by the time I went to college and now this movie is long gone, but I still remember flying it back and forth to France for several weeks a year, the crowds always cheering for the return of the plane.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this film is that the movie seems to take place in late seventies France and that will be shown on the DVD as late seventies. But I didn't like the scenes of the movie with the president of France and with the actual subject of the movie (Victor Halperin) being interviewed. The movie also goes into some stereotypes of the French in the context of the 90's and despite the fact that there's no politic"	1	0
"I enjoy Ralph Bakshi films (""Wizards"", ""Cool World"" and the nearly flawless ""Smallville"") and have seen ""Red Rock West"" and ""Cool World"" with great pleasure and interest. When I saw it in the theater I was excited to see a modern take on a famous legend of the West, Richard Brooks.<br /><br />Now I'm in the mood for this movie.<br /><br />Where it really hits home for me is the idea of the film, the theme and the symbolism of the story. As a white man in the Western, I felt I needed to take a stand, albeit in the context of the town of Stone Rock and how people treat each other; the look of the town and culture and even the attitudes of people that respect each other and the other cultures.<br /><br />The problem with Bakshi films is that they are usually more a reflection of the culture they are meant to represent than anything to do with the truth or the actual people behind the story or the spirits that actually make it. For example, in ""Maniac"" the story is based on the true story of Tony Montana; there are nothing in ""Red Rock West"" to suggest that it's based on Bakshi's vision of the era.

In 1979 Lucio Fulci released his film Zombi. However, due to contractual obligations with Luchino Visconti, Zombi 4 won't be released on video until 9/27/2000. The special features for Zombi 4 are worth the price of the DVD alone. In the reel you'll find very long sequences (about 10 minutes) that range from various clips from previous films. These sequences range from the original footage being used for the story to the video, and here Fulci utilizes them to show his theory of time dilation: In the first clip the clips were shot in slow motion which changes to slow motion in the second clip. By rotating their rotation you can see the time in the above clip diminish as they travel further and further apart.<br /><br />Of particular note is a short shot of a helicopter racing in slow motion. This is quite a few seconds more than is necessary to show Fulci's theory, but Fulci isn't using this to shock you, just to illustrate his point. You will hear many other theories mentioned, but not all of them are supported by this short shot. Also, there are numerous clips of clips from other Fulci's films that have also been used as part of Zombi 4, and these clips seem like they will get shorter and shorter a	0	1
Wow...I don't know what to say. I just watched Seven Pounds by Steven Soderbergh and I am still speechless. There are so many things I could talk about, but I'll start: The setting is New York City in the summer of 1990, and this film is about a bakery with 14 employees and a dedicated owner named Stephen Price. As you might expect, nobody likes him. Mr. Price has a sex addiction (he claims that he only has one) and when people start messing with the business, he's all up in their faces, as well as shouting profanities at the obnoxious customers that walk into the shop. Mr. Price keeps sending business cards to people, and on the day of Valentine's Day, one of them--Angela (Melissa Leo), who runs the local bar, is his secretary (I didn't know there was such a thing). When the shop owner is fired for giving one of the management secrets to his girlfriend, Mr. Price goes to Ms. Leo and immediately smashes the records of the 11 employees, after which he has the store rent out to the highest bakers in town for Valentine's Day with the proper counseling and a severance package. Of course, he also threatens to kill every other member of the shop staff. <br /><br /	1	0
"One of my favorite shows in the 80's. After the late Jerry Springer Show, I had no idea this show would one day be watched over and over again. It started as a comedy, then turned into a drama. It then turned into a comedy, then a drama, then a comedy, then a drama. And the characters changed every week.

OK, I mean, it's not very good, but it's better than most of the ""improvised"" shows. Personally, I love this one the best. It's the best because it's unlike everything else out there.

"After having watched ""Guinea Pig"", two questions come in mind: Firstly, does it work? And secondly, how did it get made? Unfortunately, this was not the answer to any of the questions I had and that's one of the reasons I gave it a 1. For if it were, everyone would probably love it! So firstly, let's start with the answer to the first question. For me the film is so bizarre that I won't even mention the details! ""Guinea Pig"" is a love story between a young man and a woman, the younger of whom by all means should be cherished; so much so that this is what makes it truly exceptional; but that also means that the young man has absolutely nothing to fall back on as to love her, she is a corpse without personality and the only thing that has moved her to true happiness is to be seen; the thoughts in the film are more than empty and totally superficial, there are no feelings left to express, just white empty spaces. Without any family, without any friends, with no girlfriend, with no friends, with no boyfriend, with no boyfriend, she is nothing but a lump of flesh; in short, a collection of random thoughts that she possesses in an endless amount of incomprehensibility and rage and exhaustion.

"This unassuming, fairly routine series deserves credit in the TV context because it offers a running time of just over 2 hours. The story concerns James Busey, a bounty hunter and priest. To protect the wealth of his religious brother, James seizes the local $5 million fortune in the form of a supernatural diamond that the wealthy wishes to keep hidden. When money becomes the butt of plot after plot, this unusual approach to the genre pays off.<br /><br />""Seed of Hope"" (as it is generally called) is a fairly typical B-movie. Nothing unusual about the setting, costumes, sets, locations, etc. There's nothing inherently original here. The basic idea of a movie set in Montana with James Busey taking on various bounty hunters is a very typical twist for B-movies. The actors perform the typical roles. No one stands out, except for the supporting cast, which includes Harry Morgan as a casino bouncer. Morgan is probably the best known of the supporting actors. He is best known for his role in ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"".<br /><br />There's a truly spectacular and incredibly entertaining scene at the end of the film when the FBI agents are being evacuated from the casino.

Now, I know French inmates are unlikely to have read any classics by Shakespeare, but I am sure that one of the most popular roles he could have played for the ages would have been the lone patient billeting at the Montmartre 'Whitechapel' where most of the 'famous' Shakespeare plays were set. Why would he want to play this role? Why bother to speak some of the famous lines to the sheriff when he could have just continued to pass a few papers along the corridors?<br /><br />I am sure that the fact that he plays the exact same role to Claudius after about half an hour of sitting on the benches doesn't mean that he is a good actor. For Claudius in 'Hamlet', all we see is his loutish arrogance which comes out in the most obvious forms when he decides to take the part of the lout by slandering his own brother for being too chatty with everyone. But then, if the audience were to notice that Claudius is a bad brother to begin with, why is he such a good friend to Penelope? He also comes across as being somewhat rude towards the equally chatty Sidon, but after that point he comes across as being sort of out of his league as far as hospitality goes.

This Wrestlemania just didn't do it for me. While some people rave about this show, I don't want to see it. The jokes weren't funny, the direction wasn't good. I mean, in the top five of most watched WWE shows in the last 4 years, this was the one where it couldn't even be ranked higher than number three. And when they got Hulk Hogan out of the ring, they didn't even try to get him to put on a good show. All those bad wrestlers were on the same mat, and I don't think I would've even bothered watching this had it not been for Tony Schiavone. There was nothing remotely funny about this show. I have to say I didn't care if Triple H had his mouth taped open, his M-Wrestling condoms falling out, or his ever reaching into a tag group.

Someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to Howlin' Wolf. It's not only the name, but the entire tone and the overall lack of content make it so perfect. What's with the rock music?

"Like other people who commented on ""Fräulein Doktor"" I stumbled upon this movie through a friend of mine's VHS copy. I have since enjoyed the movie more than I expected, and am now sad to have wasted my two hours and 100 minutes. <br /><br />What I don't understand is why did this very attractive girl want to sleep with this seemingly dull and harmless nerd? Why did she even bother to think about going through with it? This film is soo full of exposition and exposition that I had to pull the plug and turn it off.

In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead has ravaged Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world, local investigative reporter Barry University (Michael Parks) is assigned to investigate the source of the outbreak. His investigation leads him to a small, beautiful French village. There, Barry learns that his wife, Sue (Renee Fleming) is having an affair with another local villager, James Grimmer (Paul Henderson), and that he is having an affair with a younger male relative named Alexander (John Swallow). That's about all you get to know about Barry's investigation. At the conclusion of the film, Barry reports to his boss, Hugh Kellogg (Michael Ironside) and everyone else gathered at the hotel bar to determine what happened to the victims, the zombies and anyone else in the area. In short order, however, the town of Ventimiglia is under siege by the undead and will soon be the latest victims of the plague. Some of the town's inhabitants have surrendered to the government and are being ferried out of the area to be quarantined at the military base in the nearby town of Quantico.<br /><br />While the film does have its moments of clichéd special effects, the acting in the film is adequate for the material.

"The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories: 8 Year Old Savages and 2 Year Old Embezzlers. The film focuses on two little kids and what they do with the money they get (the parents and their father). The movie is about a lot of nothing. The first thirty minutes show only this, but then go on and on with nothing much going on.<br /><br />They show a lot of clips of 80's Superheroes. I would give them one star for the fact that they have a while to come up with a decent movie plot and no one really does.<br /><br />There is no character development beyond what we see in the first few minutes. We then jump into the movie at 1:30AM for the beginning, the greatest showcase for running of the mill bad ideas.<br /><br />It is obvious that the directors had the poor budget to start with. They didn't build anything out of nothing. They have never really found anything good.<br /><br />They make a point of just showing 2 year old children doing stuff in the beginning. It makes for an entertaining 90 minute fast paced movie. All I have to say is ""Take that stupid action scene back, it made for a better movie!"" There is no social commentary. That'"	1	0
The Ring was made from the only screenplay Hitchcock wrote for Hitchcock himself. It's a difficult film to watch. It's not easy for a male to look at himself in the mirror, if it's not from an experienced eye. So, when Murnau is supposed to be in a darkened room looking into the eyes of Jack Nicholson, we are meant to believe that those eyes are connected to his mind. As the film progresses and the actors get more experienced, Murnau seems less that Nicholson and more that he's the head of a crime family, an unseen baddie who needs to be taken care of and controlled by the director. One of the flaws in this film is that the very first attempt at showing Nicholson's gangster imagery is replaced by nothing more than an abrasion on Nicholson's head. The second time around it is covered up to be a reflection of a reflection in a mirror. The third time around it's a reflection on a plate in a kitchen, which is of course like showing a model to an experienced painter. The whole script is about how his place in the world is less important than mowing the lawn or committing shoplifting. This is why we are able to take so much comfort from the fact that an experienced actor (Lukas Haas, as always) plays a gangste	1	0

"I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of George Hickox and His Son, The Legend of Little Rock, and I never tire of telling this story. During the war this was my favorite way to watch TV. There are many other versions of it, for example I know of a ninety minute animation film about a hotel once owned by Roger Corman that still plays when Little Rock is on the air. But I would love to see this version of ""The Legend of Little Rock"". The nostalgia factor of the story is so strong, and I think the story itself is fascinating to watch. And the accents are excellent. My son also loved this version as well and now has a copy of the book. It was beautifully directed by Anthony Hopkins and includes many references to the movie, the soldier George Hickox, the black workers, Sissy Spacek and so many more.<br /><br />There are so many examples of how little-known westerns were integrated by Hollywood, but this is probably the greatest example.

Nicolas Roeg ? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW (1975) and that was what I thought of this one. His adaptation of Stephen King`s DON`T LOOK NOW was also a pretty good film. <br /><br />The only thing that kept me from completely hating this movie was the time period it was set in. It was 1950s America.<br /><br />Although I was not aware that the Time Lord was from the future, I thought his speech lacked any real depth. But the rest of the movie was like a continuation of TIME HERE in the 1980s.<br /><br />When the scientists say they found an antidote to the deadly salmonella, they actually prescribe it to make sure it doesn`t spread.

"As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I am saddened by this show. I am still just thinking ""Is it just me or is this just as bad as the first season of Lost?"" and ""Is this just as bad as the second season of Lost?"" But if you have the misfortune of viewing all three, this show will put you to sleep and cause you to weep with laughter. There's nothing really new and exciting about the TV series, but I could be wrong and maybe it could have been so much better, but I just found it to be terrible. Maybe it's my opinion, but I'm pretty disappointed in this show. The graphics look awesome and the music is very well done, but at times it seems like there's too much emphasis on the flying, the shark scenes and the end. The best part about this show is not the flying, but the people who don't let their kids watch it. If you are looking for a fun TV show to have with your family and your younger brother, I'd say leave this one out of the mix. "	1	0
In the Hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch - thanks to the bloodsuckers of the late '30s and early '40s. If your local area film noir wasn't already shot with this guy's trail mules, it's not hard to figure out that Hollywood still expects its trail-hands to make their victims as decent as possible. True Hollywood trail-hands did more than make up the movie narrative. They made the movie. And, in many ways, Hollywood could be kind to its slugs. But not this one. Perhaps that would get at the core of Hollywood's beef with slugs and with those little bastards - if they had any at all. In this movie nobody seems to care what happens to these jerks. On a more generous assessment they're the most popular slugs on Earth, so why can't the producers of the movie follow the trail-hands and pay them for their time and talent? <br /><br />This is part of what makes the '33 version so interesting. The mice of the age were at their grubby best. We see that sort of stuff here as much as we see in today's C-level heavyweights. And believe me, 'em and their run-of-the-mill stories are awesome.

"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What is fascinating about this movie is the fact that it was made in the 30's - the 60's. It contains all the typical trappings of a teen movie (innocent boy becomes a killer, real-life dad sees his son in cinema and murders him).<br /><br />I found this movie in an anthology at my local library. There are about 5 lines that I thought were especially interesting. The ""veins and passions of one of the main characters"" are an interesting concept to me, given the sheer cruelty of the movie. Certainly an appropriate reference for any audience. <br /><br />There is one other good thing that I found interesting - there was no violence and no nudity in the movie, in spite of many scenes of sex. I just happened to be watching this from the other side of the movie and I thought it was quite exciting to see so many naked females in a movie. <br /><br />If there is a need for a truly graphic act to accompany a scene of violence, I would recommend ""Police Story"" (1960) by Walter Matthau. But ""Roman Troy Moronie"" is very educational in showing that you don't have to have a grown man killing innocent women to be shocking. It'"	1	0
"Like a lot of series pilots, Dark Angel's opener shows more tension than it should. In this case, it's an early fight scene between the ships, with the furious effects of battle on everyone's face. And if you think that was the least of the show's problems, it was the culmination of much more: a confused explanation for the mysterious ""black hole"" that supposedly transports dead bodies from one area of space to another. Without the introduction of the concept, I was really confused how it tied into the rest of the show. The low budget 'we're watching a sci-fi show' was puzzling. With them spending so much time making and filming scenes with lots of wind and such, I can only assume some members of the crew had less money than their character would be in real life.<br /><br />The sequence towards the end when the ship and men are docked with the ship's hold on another planet was especially off. Having been there and done that, it just didn't feel realistic. The only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is that the character I guess was trying to force an explanation on me was somewhat charismatic, but he had little effect. In any case, not one member of the crew was really convincing. I wasn't convinced what ""real"" happens to these character"	1	0
"Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will surely hate this show. In fact, I've never seen the show before so I'm not sure if this is a compliment. There's a lot of stupid talk and violence and I got the feeling the show has no idea what it wants to do with its very existence. To me the most bizarre aspect of the show are the episodes about adult humans getting killed and all that junk. What is it with this show! I mean seriously, anime has a lot of violent/so-called adult content, you've got Gundam Wing, Zoids, Cowboy Bebop, Street Fighter, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Legend of Zu, Aokiji, Guilty Crown, Kamisama Kiss, Suzuka, Castle in the Sky and Samurai Flamenco, and I'm pretty sure there are more. I mean, the plot is so dumb that I'll actually sit through them, only because I'm curious to see the outcome. The execution in comparison to the other shows is amazing. The best episode to me is ""Kudekiri no Oragami"" which is what they call ""adolescent violence"" but it is very realistic. There are also episodes about how ridiculous and fake Japanese high school life can be like. This show almost always brings u"	1	0
When I first heard about the show, I heard a lot about 'Julia' and my reaction was one of horror. I wasn't that scared of it. After all, it's part of a cult series and it's made by a guy with a'meltdown' (a slang term for drop dead gorgeous women). That was never a problem for me. After watching this show, however, that changed. I began to get scared. I mean, that a show like 'Julia' that's been around for over 10 years can get by and come out unscathed is just plain crazy.<br /><br />What I mean is that Julia was quite possibly the most mind-boggling show ever put on television. It took me five minutes to figure out the mystery behind Julia's family, and I have never gotten the fine detail of who the daughter is, why she's here, and how she got there. I mean, we're supposed to believe the male lead is completely insane - but that's what you might think of the unknowns of the lead. It's got to be to much to trust the male lead after watching an episode of 'Julia' for so long.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention that whenever Julia decides to show up at a student'	1	0
"The case is the best part of the movie but it fails badly in the rest. The movie is too long and it's heavy handed. As the story goes from one point to the next I was surprised that it didn't change into a melodrama, and this did make it a pity that there wasn't a stronger pace and more intelligent wordplay in it. Some reviewers give this movie some credit because it's the best Swedish film since ""Svenska"" and all Swedish films nowadays are this way. But the case is that this film is for contemporary audience only. This is not a satire in any sense of the word, but of society today and its complicated issues. I have to say that at times it gave me trouble to watch it because it's too over-style but overall it's a good film. All sorts of weird situations with sex, terrible language, absurd situations, violent scenes, dream sequences, lots of people falling asleep in it (and there is even a certain shower scene!) and an over-the-top German sex joke, go on the next page. You will get more out of this film than out of many other Swedish films. But if you want to see the whole story without the sex joke, you'll have to watch this movie yourself. "	0	1
"For some reason, this film has never turned up in my rental queue on IMDb. The short was released in September 2007, so perhaps the Japanese version was never completed. The Japanese version has not been released on DVD/VHS and I've just been told that it has been released in theaters in Japan by Columbia, which makes me wonder why. This film had an enormous theatrical release and was highly promoted by its release. My gut feeling is that it will be more a hit on DVD in Japan than the US. If I were a Japanese citizen, I would definitely want this film on my DVD/VHS shelf for those who really need it. To compare this film to ""Dr. Doolittle"" or anything else would be silly. To call this film a comedy, the films slapstick formula of the two would be laughable in a movie such as ""Cannon Fodder"". It is never shown to be violent in any way, though violence is shown towards the end, when Tetsuo has fought his way to the top of the building.

"This film started out very promising with the story about the inept soldier who has to take on the bad guys in the video game game industry. After an initial shoot 'em up style with some cool special effects the film quickly dropped off for a typical action film. The characters were bad, the motivations were lame and the good guys got defeated with ease. It didn't help that James Woods never gets any screen time and the bad guys simply get captured and become targets of the ""good guys"". In conclusion, the video game industry and this film are two completely different things and it takes more than a quickie remake to bring them together. I would rate this film 7 out of 10. "	0	1
"Someone has already mentioned ""being at the right time at the wrong place"", and I want to point out that that is as true here as in any other film. Though I will admit to making the same mistake ""two years later"" (in another review) of not watching this film that I saw with my husband and the title card doesn't match. But when you make that mistake with some type of film you should be able to ignore the differences of view as you will, and once again I commend Blythe Danner-led team for trying to do the best with what they had. But a disclaimer: if you've ever seen a movie that features Catherine Zeta Jones in an off-screen role, you probably already know what I'm talking about (check out her in a guest starring role in the own ""possibilities"").<br /><br />My only quibble with the film is the brief appearance of Bonny, who apparently had not received the script, which was all wrong: instead of the ""damsel in distress"" (what a term you get in a film), we get a woman with problems. She simply looks bored, like she's waiting for a favor in the mail (the viewer can see she's not entirely sure who she's dealing with as she tells Zeta Jones of"	1	0

"Orson Welles' ""The Lady From Shanghai"" does not have the usual sentimental qualities that go with the film and is far from what is expected from Welles. It is a tense, slow moving, silent film, so much so that it would work as a short or a TV movie with the right kind of audio commentary for it, but what this film lacks in appeal it makes up for with acting ability. Joe Piscopo is excellent as the cad, and looks at home in a Joe Pesci western. The rest of the cast is very good, but the only actor that impresses me in this is Clive Owen as Mr. Faraday, in a fine silent movie about an anti-corporatist. My Grade: B- <br /><br />Elvira, Connecticut <br /><br />{RATING 3.5/5}<br /><br />Dolph Lundgren has always been one of the better performers in movies that I have ever seen, and one of my favorite actors, but he really gets a little bump in this film. The problem is that it is not one of his best performances. While there is no doubt that Lundgren is the star of this film, there is not really a big script to get around him as far as being an actor. However"	1	0
"So this was an HBO ""Made for TV Movie"" eh? Well OK then I'll say that for this one it was good, it could've been better, it had several things right it was interesting to see what would happen with some of the main characters, I was also pleased with the fight scenes although not impressive at all, they made up for it. This isn't a feature length movie but it should have been for the money they spent. All in all it was an hour and ten minutes and unless you are a huge fan of this show you'll miss the point very quickly.<br /><br />Personally I'd rather watch ""South Park"" or if something else comes out of it, and I don't mean Lifetime or Cinemax either, if you really really need that, to buy something worth watching, you can look at Amazon or to TV wise, most of the people I saw said that they wanted to watch this again and again, if they just watch it for about a half hour a week and catch it in a slow time slot and not for money, it will work for you. But if you want to see something for free.. stick with that like I did and check the box at the bottom so you'll get the maximum return. "	0	1
"Despite being released on DVD by Blue Underground some five years earlier than this mess, I still thought that this was a great film to buy. One of the things that set it apart was that it was based on a true story. With the exception of a good number of scenes that were all clichéd (such as a sequence where Paulie repeatedly spits out flying cockroaches), this film has all the elements of a film made in Hollywood. The trouble is that, for all its appeal as a good story, it is about as true to life a story this side of White Men Can't Jump.<br /><br />What is great about this movie is that it is still a very good film. There are many scenes that seem out of place (such as when a plumber announces his intention to make a home in ""Camp Crazies"", but the audience is not informed that the building it is interested in is actually in a condemned shack). There are some films, though, that try to parody this by just having the hero make a number of cliched decisions, but with such a lack of depth to any of them that they almost look funny. The king of the cliched decisions is the aforementioned character; Ben. He appears to be every stereotypically charismatic person that can be found in an"	0	1
Did you know, that Anthony Kiedis, (singer from the Red Eye)...also plays the head of the church? <br /><br />Being a fan of his for several years, I was hoping that I would get to see some of his work on the big screen, but sadly, I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />After i watched the movie and sat down to finish it, I thought that there were a few problems with the movie. The director and screenwriter I believe chose to showcase butch people in their story, and for some reason, the homosexual issues aren't addressed. <br /><br />Some of the action scenes are stiff and dragged out. The gay sub-plots are flat out unnecessary and completely exaggerated. <br /><br />I was disappointed when seeing this on the big screen, because i was hoping for a little more depth. 	1	0
Doris Day never lets a bad script get her down. She steals every scene she's in. She's even been known to make several wardrobe changes at the same time.<br /><br />If you're going to make a movie about a porn star, be sure to include an extra in each scene so we can have some pleasure watching them lose it. Add another couple of nerds for something that might make some friends. And put some good acting in for no real reason, as when Rita Newcombe (Doris Day) and her most fanatical fan, Spanky the Cookie Monster (John Bonham Carter) break into Day's parents' house to steal pizza for themselves and their son, and that's no minor spoiler.<br /><br />So long as you don't have much cheese or porn, it's a good movie that I actually enjoyed. It's got a very pleasant cast, which includes the absolutely hilarious Fred Willard, played perfectly by Goodrich. John Sommers II also gets good support. 	0	1
This movie was very enjoyable, though you'll only like it if you've seen the American version. It's about a low-class truck driver/anti-heroine named Bell in Los Angeles (where I live, mind you). She works on the side of a company called Diamond City and is admired by everyone there. The hero she follows is Chris, a truck driver with big aspirations and plans to become a singer/prostitute (he plans to work with a stripper, make porno films, and get into politics, but that's another story). The plot is dull and utterly boring, and unfortunately the acting is ham-fisted and contrived.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is that it features one of the funniest and down-to-earth comedic performances of the last few years in Eva Longoria. It's a shame the people involved had to deal with the severe flaws in this movie, because even her acting wasn't enough to redeem it. There was absolutely no reason to sit through this movie, and no way to sit through the rest of it. I don't know why I stopped watching halfway through, but I did. This is the perfect choice for someone who enjoys very low-budget low-brow stuff that gets laughs without being pretentious or glib	1	0
I loved this movie, I'll admit it. This has to be my favorite movie of all time. It's very simple, it's smart and it's got a great storyline. The plot is pretty simple, but it still makes you think and it makes you think, and it makes you think, because it gives you so many possibilities in what you could have done with this movie and yet this movie never gets you thinking. The story was basically a bunch of little images and text, and some hilarious moments.<br /><br />I don't know how you can go wrong with John Waters movies, or of anybody's movies. As for this one, I gave it 2 stars out of 10, and I don't think anybody should ever give this movie any less than 10 stars. 	0	1
"This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring Bebe Daniels in 1958 and Christopher Walken in 1996. Ebert says that he has seen almost all of them. He writes: ""with a slightly higher bloodline in many of the stories, the films are more of a mixture of black and white.<br /><br />One problem with this movie: The ending was very predictable.<br /><br />Another problem: The actors looked more like their action movies of the time. Not funny. Probably this is the main reason I found the film very boring. I wonder if movies like this are better to portray not being able to change your life but being stuck at your normal position. Ebert is more or less right.<br /><br />Since this film has 2 stars, and may earn 9 more, I would say that this movie is worth watching. I have seen the ""Network"" and ""Law and Order"" series and they are better films. A feeling of dislocation after your child leaving home without you. "	1	0
"I disliked Frosty returns and this one. Both of the Robert Byrne films were great. Frowny has been remade in the 70's. Or so I thought.<br /><br />It is now 30 years since I saw this one.

A film I expected very little from, and only watched because someone listed it on the recent Amazon UK video store. It's a comedy set in China, that has exactly the right tone, style and feel to make it all the more enjoyable. At the start, the movie starts out with a lull in between lots of jabs at modern China and the culture that surrounds it. Afterwards the pace picks up and people start to show up at the offices of the characters, as a real action unfolds. Honestly, the entire film just made me feel like I was in a comedy. Almost every scene is filled with mindless 90's references and fast forwarding that only serves to highlight its sheer hilarity. I can't really recommend watching this movie for anyone in particular, just anyone that enjoyed a much funnier contemporary comedy. 	1	0
"(SPOILERS IN THIS)<br /><br />""Rosenstraße"" is a movie about heroic Jewish revolutionaries against German occupation. The goal of the movie is to show that Jewish revolutionaries in Germany were not only patriotic, but anti-Nazi. The movie does not show that they were also reformist, and that they eventually turned pro-Nazi. Instead, it's shown that they were pros, that they ended up winning WWII. How do we know this? That's because there is no source that details that the ""Rosenstraße"" is a film about the Jew-rally in Stuttgart. Instead, it is more a primer on how to train and conduct a revolution. Yes, there are definitely some Jews in the city, but they weren't helping to organize the march. Also, the picture the ""Rosenstraße"" is based on was originally a porn movie, not a documentary. I hope it's because by now you've taken your kids to see this movie. To all you ""scholar"" who say this film is a classic, show me a three minute ""action"" scene of a movie about the Jewish cause. I'd take it over any documentary. "	0	1
"I watched this film not expecting much and not knowing how bad it would be. I was totally wrong. The film is so awful it is funny. The movie stars both Paul Rudd and Channing Tatum in their most notorious roles in the beginning. The first part is quite watchable, mostly because we see how the male leads became well known. But there are some funny bits as well. John Cusack is also great as the humorless cop and at first, Tatum plays the stereotypical hot-shot cop. He's in the movie for a while but it turns out he's just a stereotypical hot-shot cop. You can tell he doesn't really care about the situation. I would like to say Channing Tatum does a great job but there is just a part where she walks into a room and it's supposed to be another movie. And the picture is the picture. I'd love to see more of his movies, but unfortunately, he doesn't do a lot of them anymore. Overall, an even worse film than ""Zoolander"" and ""There's Something About Mary"". "	1	0

I laughed with many of the characters in the movie, especially Ned Kelly's father, who is a New York City cab driver. My favorite scenes from ""Home Sweet Home"" were:<br /><br />1.

The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment...this time in the form of a rather elderly man with a bad case of the Cold. This time around, the killer is known as the Matador and he only wants to have sex with the first woman he visits in the form of a clerk who works in the basement of a shopping mall. By simply walking through her window and allowing him to explore her, the Matador is able to complete his mission of the day and brutally rape her and one of her customers. This is not to be taken as anything but horrific as it is actually a brilliantly constructed murder mystery with some excellent writing and some intriguing twists throughout the film. There is a good amount of suspense throughout the film as there is always the possibility that the killer is a composite personification of the past. The special effects are not something you will see in every film, but they are sometimes worth the effort to look at. I especially enjoyed the scene where the apartment the Matador is hiding in appears to be a false one with an air conditioner. The characters are all very well developed and it is hard to imagine that they could get away with such a diabolical and sickening plan. However, given the amount of good writing that is plastered across this movie, that it doesn't become to	0	1
Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins a rifle, a Winchester in the coolest contest ever. He now must bring it back to the old school for accuracy. McAdam's idea is to use his new rifle to help put an end to the evil corporation. McAdam is a good guy with a big heart.<br /><br />First off, it's a bad film. It does rely on cheap effects and location photography to make it look realistic, but it's still a bad film. There isn't anything really new in the film, and the action moves very slow. Why? Because it's the story, stupid. When this film was made, there was little promotion for it. It was the year of the Columbine Massacre. Because of this, people didn't care to see a good film until 1998. The same year the film came out, there were one or two decent box office grossing movies. These were far better than this weak, dull pile of junk.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre. If I had to choose one main complaint about the film, it's that it doesn't do a good job with the setting. Most movies have some pretty old setting in the beginning. This film seems to forget that. Most of the shooting is in this generic rural Wisconsin town. This setting is supposed t	1	0
Preston Waters is off to a bad summer. Besides his famous cowboy shorts and Stix for God's sake, he's been having trouble fitting in with the rest of his local milieu. His boyish looks and laid-back attitude don't exactly make for a good solution for this need, especially when there are real-life teenage boys who feel the same way about him.<br /><br />There are two big problems with Waters' sudden change of scene. The first is that Waters is starring in a series of movies in which he's playing all the same roles. Sometimes it works, other times not. Not only does it eat up two hours of screen time, it also adds a new level of annoyingness.<br /><br />The second problem is that while the other actors might appear to be all in the same boat as the bigger fish, they are actually not. Instead of being completely consumed by his desire to become the first gay cowboy, Tom Everett Paine, Waters is more concerned with chasing after the more attractive young boys for the next decade. He has to do this on many levels, not all of them good.<br /><br />If you've seen a lot of movies or probably read enough books to make it through most of this diatribe, you'll find yourself looking at Water	1	0
"This series premiered on the cable TV station ""Comedy Central"" in 1969 and immediately became a hit. It was too early to see the transition from the gay press to the mainstream. It also was too early to see the transition from black crime films to movies that had a story and characters. This is definitely the beginning of the ""death penalty by lack of a trial"" phenomenon. Like Malcolm X's defense team, now all of the movies dealing with people who are executed (and, in some cases, murderers) are being made these days. The small town police force of Fargo, North Dakota is on the run after the deputy sheriff who killed their friend was killed by someone else. On the night of the trial, the deputy shoots and kills one of the defendants. Then he does it again, another nine minutes later, and he's out for revenge! All this on the first night of a cold and windy winter, when there's just no other place for it. Every little detail, every single word has to fit into a long film. So you have a mystery, a murder, a secret and an unlikely star in the making (and who else?) David Niven. In those days, you didn't need much else besides the ability to set the camera. Niven wasn't tall, but he made the scene loo"	1	0
I tried to watch this movie in a military camp with approximately 500 men. The main problem with this movie is that in the movie there is only one complete series of events. No one except for the father and son were cut out of the movie. The other three families were left out. Without this missing episode of the movie you could not believe the events that happened in this movie. There was no training camp with the American troops who were training in South Africa. In a war these kinds of exercises would be used to train the enemy. The director did a good job in capturing the spirit of the two principals of this movie. And not to mention the dialogue between father and son. This is a very good movie that depicts the closest thing that you could find with normal people and a very realistic portrayal of what is going on in a military training camp. If you go to see this movie just make sure you don't miss any of the events. You won't regret it. 	0	1
Tintin and I recently aired as an episode of PBS's Japanese Classics series. The story in it was about an apparently successful Col. Martin Prospero (the former King of Col. Mario) who has to share with his wife's brother (a gentle-man, and guy who still gets a kick out of stamping) his castle with his infant son. After many strange complications involving soldiers and attempts at raising him in a family environment and an unhappy family, you can see a war started.<br /><br />The movie, which I think you could see and maybe even rent at your local video store if you didn't mind video quality, was good (possibly better than Tintin, in the old Col.Mario department), but while I loved the animation (or rather, the animated visuals), I have to say I was disappointed by the picture quality. It's difficult to get those bright white bars that are found on most modern motion picture graphics when you're watching a movie, so I was disappointed that these old-time film files looked like (or perhaps I should say that I should have thought that it looked like) paint on the picture.<br /><br />Some people in the comments have mentioned that the soundtrack is much better than the picture, and they're spot on. In most movies, when yo	1	0
"I have to start by telling you how I came to discover this movie. I was going out to see a film in the mall when I decided to check out Denzel Washington's ""Without You"" as I never actually heard of this film before. I was so disappointed with it. I searched all day long for a copy and finally found one in the mall's video rental aisle. And what an amazing surprise! I had never heard of this film and had not even been to one movie theater prior to this. I didn't even know that there was a real existence of such a movie. And the extras that came with it were beyond my expectations. Just plain spectacular. They even took a 'tireless' nude shot and played it with special effects for those of us in a hurry.<br /><br />I have seen Denzel Washington many times and I must say, this is the best movie I have seen him in. I mean come on, how can you be bad at this stuff? Really, that is it. So if you are looking to see a really good film, come on out to the movie theater. You won't regret it. "	1	0
"If you were ever sad for not being able to find yourself as a single person, this film is for you. The story could actually be better. In that regard, the acting is spotty, with some characters straying off character. That's not a major problem in the story, however, since this is a holiday movie and we're all supposed to care about others.<br /><br />However, the story makes much of its relationship to sex, and, in fact, is obsessed with that. In many ways, the role of sex in the movie is akin to that of love, although it's different in that you have to know someone beforehand and want to have sex. (The story also deals with relationships between kids and adults.) This movie seems to feel a great deal about wanting to be a good friend, something many of us often think is a virtue, and yet it's never actually good enough to help us become a strong couple. And then the movie is truly sad. While it deals with the need to have sex, the story moves in a certain amount of insipid ways. In one especially depressing scene, people leave messages on other people's doors with a message like: ""Look for Sally. She may be out there. You never know."" Where is Sally? Are you sad fo"	1	0
"Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girl costumes.<br /><br />Wonderful movie, but I don't see how it can be called ""cult"" because it's not supposed to be really. You just have to watch it to understand it for yourself. I am a big fan of director William Gwynne (Spaceballs) and don't think this is his best film. After viewing this movie and seeing his quality work, I really wish that he would make more low budget, high budget sci-fi movies. I know that in the old days he would not have accepted ""Transformers"" for ""Fringe"" but this movie was still a pretty good vehicle for him to put his characters to a good use. <br /><br />In short, there are not too many ""cult"" sci-fi movies and I am glad that I didn't see any. If you are looking for a really good low budget sci-fi movie, try checking out ""Cube"" or ""Hardboiled"". "	0	1
This started out to be a movie about the street kids living on an island. In the final 30 minutes, it veers into horror, action, and sexploitation. The supporting cast is average. So is the script. The acting is sub-par. If you like the cheesy 80's horror movies, there are worse ones out there. If you like flying bulldozers and island costumes, then this is for you. 	1	0
I am, as many are, a fan of Tony Scott and Michelle Forbes. I just don't think that they do a very good job directing. On the other hand, I do really like Jason Scott, he's really fun to watch. I really did like the way this movie was created, although it wasn't well-done in some parts. I think it could have used some slightly better acting in some parts. I also didn't like how the action scenes were shot, and there wasn't anything good to say about it. The last few minutes was a little disappointing, although it did have one or two good moments. Overall, I would suggest not paying attention to this movie, but for a good time, check out Tony Scott's appearance in Revolution: Cuba 1968, which I have compared better.<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars 	0	1
This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I saw and it's not that I didn't like it. I just thought it was pretty slow in its pacing. The acting is somewhat poor, but it's not too bad as the direction is very very good. There's a good montage sequence which really does give you an idea of the movie's pace. While Jason Scott Lee's acting is weak, the story is fairly good and the effects are good. 	0	1
"There is an old saying that relates to the rousing appeal of songs ""to get the heart going in the first place."" In our generation, this has been misused to the benefit of television. The battle for hearts and minds has become a virtual thing, a result of television's spread. Idol groups seem to have a fairly severe reputation on what I call ""distaste polls"", where fans give each other ratings for their favorite bands or songwriters. It's the best-sellers gone bad.<br /><br />Hair of the Dog's ""Mighty Mouse,"" which came out in the 1950s, could well be ""Mighty Mouse Overdrive,"" if this were an American public. In its visual sophistication, its sweeping cinematic vision and its patented wit, ""Hip Hop Cinema,"" (a.k.a. graffiti) must have been too gushing to be attributed to a nation so far removed from ""Art Deco."" Compared to this unholy offering, what ""Mighty Mouse"" had to say about this era is more than compelling, with its collection of West Coast icons and its concept of ""money in the streets,"" especially in New York. Although this is not to say that this didn't have its merits, I'd like to suggest that some credibility was lost on those who watched thi"	1	0
"This is a well made informative film in the vein of documentaries such as ""The Earth in Space"" and ""The Great Indian Flood"". The writer/director of this film, Ted Landon, is an excellent documentary filmmaker and has worked on various documentaries. I have seen him do more on documentaries than almost anyone but the movie does have it's share of flaws.<br /><br />In this film we see the image of humans in space and on earth. It is a fairly informative film without being gory.

A few of the examples listed here may seem appealing to some but what happens to the other 2 examples listed below?<br /><br />***1/2 of the 4 examples you are presented are of human beings in space (with or without a helmet).

A big surprise, probably because I was expecting it to be rubbish (which it was, by the way). In fact, I thought this was going to be a bore-fest with a plot that was nothing more than a buffoonish blunder. It is a shame because I could have guessed this film would be a genuine pile of waste by the lightening pace of some reviewers and by the weird display of drugs in the beginning.<br /><br />The film, on the whole, suffers from a single major flaw, and that is that it is not clever. Sure, it's bad, but it's really bad. As a modern art film (think Blade Runner, although in a much more realistic setting), it doesn't belong in the comments section with the likes of the aforementioned directors.<br /><br />The plot follows a highly decorated field medic, Morgan (Casper Hardesty), who is training in an underground bunker, being hunted by an unpleasant government agent, Karl (Al Pacino), who is a tough little rookie in the local CIA, and he's out to get Morgan. <br /><br />While Pacino plays the usual smart-aleck, hard-ass FBI agent, Hardesty is forced to play an even more pathetic role as Karl's scheming boyfriend, Karl 	1	0
At your video store, you might find this gem.<br /><br />Jane Powell plays a housewife who lives in the country and has a baby son, Charlie. She then catches a business trip to Italy and is surprised to find it's all really like she remembered. The next day she gets a call about her kid's birth, but before she can give the news to Charlie, she discovers her husband's fate: He's been shot with an old pistol in the head. There is a conspiracy involving the mafia to have her killed and a white-collar crook, who hasn't spoken to her in years, posing as her sister who she couldn't remember going to Italy.<br /><br />I do have to admit though that there are several parts that may actually drag. There is a fairly unrealistic climax where we get the full story but then the movie falls back on a routine and inane plot. There are the shots of Powell as she gazes down at her baby with real and imagined violent looks on her face. This is hard to watch and I like watching a film for it's own sake but it just drags a bit. There are many holes in the film. First of all, why would anyone run out into the field with a gun if it's supposed to be locked in a safe in the kitchen	1	0
"I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors make horror films and this is the first one I've seen. A post Iranian cinema of badness. The cinematography is incredibly bad and the character design is terrible. It's set in an absolutely empty, red looking village. The only landmarks are two ruins and a river (you could almost see the waves washing over them!). There are no scenes of evil or blood. There are some awful effects and sex. The ""actors"" are uniformly evil, but it's the badness of the script and the utterly fake Egyptian dubbing that makes the cinema so awful. So good for the actors.

"I will start by saying that this has undeservedly be placed amongst the worst movies I have ever seen. This is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination and I do understand the critics for it's poor choices. As I understand it, the idea of a television host who can have supernatural powers only adds to the awfulness of the movie. And when you add that supernatural powers make it hard to predict what is going to happen to them. It was as if, in order for the filmmakers to have a certain sense of wonder, they got everyone to go along with every plot twist. You have Nancy Grace trying to argue that people are somehow better than television hosts because they have supernatural powers, and you have Lou Dobbs arguing that everything is perfectly normal because everyone is normal, in both senses of the word. The way in which these people try to cast doubt in each other is inexcusable. They are sure of each other's riddles because they know each other's ""personalities"" so well.<br /><br />No one is even remotely good in this movie, and that's not all.

But if you like the muppets I defy you to find fault with this rather poor half-hour of British TV. The story line itself is weak, the writing practically non-existent, and the whole thing only feels like an episode of a missing-in-action kids show. It's pathetic to watch when you are literally overwhelmed by the sheer number of Disney comedies being churned out these days. Even more so when you realize that 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' takes place somewhere in the 50s. I don't know how any of the actors can react to this. How is anybody supposed to care about any of this in the worst Christmas tradition since Scrooge?<br /><br />My advice to anyone who reads this far is to walk out, immediately. Unless you are a major film buff who enjoys the weird stuff that might be happening in a Christmas movie, stay away. And make sure you won't miss anything. 	1	0
"Aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot twists and turns, ""The Human Face"" is the sort of film that stands the test of time. Despite that, it is still one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. The story, in fact, is so well conceived and crafted that it is nearly impossible to believe that the movie really happened. Even Lucas himself acknowledged that it was true in a letter to Roth, though he did not give the year. However, it appears that the making of ""The Human Face"" was never about the finished product itself. Instead, it is credited to William Powell and George Lucas, who had previously collaborated on ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" and ""Attack of the Clones."" According to Roth's book, the new franchise film would have been ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" a movie which was already a failure. ""An Empire Stood Still"" would have been ""Return of the Jedi,"" with Anthony Quinn playing a Jedi who was separated from his Padawan, Luke Skywalker. But the fact remains, that this was a great idea for a film, and for sure, this idea may have been useful in the beginning of a new Lucasfilm movie (like any other company).<br /><br />Despite all this, ""The Human Face"" wa"	0	1

Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is exposed.<br /><br />It's not just the screen time.

After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99$ bin at Future Shop last summer, I had to see this one to see if it was worth my time. A lot of movies are right up my alley, and this one really takes the cake.

Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by the venomous species of the species Heteropoda (Lapicoptera), and his body violently mutates into a tiger-man. But when he returns to Europe, he's left a mark on his face and a hideous scar (what should be made into a mask or a scarring cream) which attracts the attention of Drosselmeyer (the legendary Bram Stoker). The Police are called, and Daninsky is bitten by a similar species of the same species, but this time, rather than violently mutating, he is tranquilized and placed in a sanitarium. Daninsky returns with an extremely ugly and unkempt appearance...and then his teeth turn white and begin to grow back!<br /><br />Naschy is surprisingly appealing in this dark and sad-looking little man; as the tone is set with his usual mild grimy charm (and this film is probably a adaptation of a novel by Marcel Proust), he plays the part with considerable relish. It is not his usual fine performance, which is fairly average in those films where he gets to play himself in a rather marginal role. His role here is just average, and there is a weird tendency for him to think that all of his actin	0	1

First, this is a review of the two disc set of Godzilla movies I own. I am not a fan of the first one (Japanese B-grade actioner), and I'm a fan of the second one (post-2001 monster/series R-rated story). What I like about Godzilla 3 (also released in 2004) is that it is more faithful to the Japanese originals (2004's Godzilla vs. Megalon and 2004's Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah) and doesn't try too hard to be an Americanized version. In fact, the make-up effects are actually more realistic, considering the era (1990's). I've never heard anything negative about this version of the series, and I'm inclined to agree with those who gave it good reviews. On a more negative note, as a former fan of the Godzilla films, I'm very disappointed to find that the upcoming sequel to Godzilla does not further solidify my faith in this magnificent creature. Although the Japanese B-grade action film may seem like a more realistic take on the series, this is not the case. The original Godzilla could have been very watchable, but there were certain areas where it just seemed over-the-top and unbelievable. Godzilla 3 is simply the next evolution of the monster series and tries to take it even further in ne	1	0
The movie is a real show of how unemotional and emotionless children can be. The entire movie is about the parent in the beginning trying to fix the child and eventually he can't. If you have any common sense that would go with the movie, it is a lot better. The first actor as Peter Hamby, would make an excellent actor. He did not look emotionless at all. But he always tried to get some dignity to his character. But in the end, it turns out his character is not as bad as he had thought. It is a shame that Hamby did not get a bigger role in more movies. He is very important for acting but his performance in this movie is not as good as Hamby thought it would be. This movie did not really have a purpose but something for the children. I would recommend this movie to parents to help the children to be happy. 	1	0
"It's always nice to see Angela Bassett getting to do something sexy again. This one is about an old guy (John Ritter) living in an old house in Brooklyn. He lives in an almost way too old house. There's no real waste of space, and all of the windows and doors are boarded up. The worst thing about it is the whole townspeople live around here: two farmers, two doctors, a cab driver, and a woman who does real, real weird yard work.<br /><br />I think the main problem with the film is that most of the time it's dull. There are too many scenes of dialog and unnecessary nudity and bad acting. But the other things that make this flick actually bearable are the performances: Angela Bassett is a very sexy chick who doesn't do the kind of sexy roles that most porn stars do, but who is pretty good in this film. John Ritter is another ""guy"", but he doesn't say a word in the film.

"Uggh! I really wasn't that impressed by this film, though I suppose it would not be the first attempt of Uwe Boll to make a trashy horror film. It certainly had the worst death scene I have ever seen in a movie. For the record, I was not scared at all. I laughed out loud once and the worst thing was that it was just... poorly done. Worse than any drug movie I have ever seen. Not bad, just bad. But I don't know how Boll could justify making a film like this, as I would really rather have a foggy midnight movie at my house, accompanied by four inches of snow and a bottle of vodka.<br /><br />I have to say that this movie had some nice touches. There was some humor, some ""Halloween""-esque dialogue, and a few good gore scenes, which put it into a category of its own.

Hey now, I can't claim to have seen all of these classics (this is the first one I did see, I should have followed one of his serials with Memoirs of a Geisha, but that one was too hard on the acting, and the second one was even better)but I saw one of the earlier classic films in Europe, it was quite good and thrilling. Or did it? Well, I don't remember, but I did see the early, but quite underrated (thankfully) Meikleborg and of course The Tenant, both of which were quite good and I recall they made some wonderful movies there.

"The Tooth Fairy is set in a small town somewhere in Maine about 60 years before the original film. It's not a great movie but I thought it was quite enjoyable. The plot is simple and the setting is appropriate. But on the whole I think the best part of the film is the enchanted guest character played by the equally charming Joan Blondell. She never quite rises above her typical likable role as the kind of tired woman you'd find in an old Saturday-morning cartoon but her charms have a kind of charm to them. Lorne Greene, the producer, picked her up and worked with her on her film career. She's seen in several episodes of Miss Congeniality, the early 70's anthology series from Warner Brothers. When they weren't making movies, the pair occasionally teamed up to make short videos. Other notable work included Bonanza, a poorly made, overly silly ""horror"" movie from 1991. Blondell herself has appeared in an episode of NBC's The Honeymooners. "	0	1
A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of gore and rage. The story is rather simple: a young girl is kidnapped from a busy train station and murdered. The killer of the series, especially in this version, is Mr. Robot, a whiny computer controlling guy with a stereotypical Jewish haircut (but a decent facial expression). On a train ride home, his estranged brother ends up killing an elderly couple. The killer kills the husband in the library, and, in order to cover up his own father's crime, Mr. Robot drives his own car through a railroad crossing to get to the Bronx. After leaving the victim's body in the woods for several days, the killer stashes the body in the attic of the father's house and begins replacing blood and bits of the victim with bits of the computer. The family dogs soon show up and start chasing the killer, and police soon show up and start chasing the killer and his jugs (though not enough to stop the attacking dogs from chasing and murdering the family's pets). The film is also acted in a rather tacky '80s style, with many of the characters speaking with gruff, gruff high-pitched voices and body language that would shame the animators of the `80s and `90s.

The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese samurai dancing on a bonfire. As the camera pans on, the landscape morphs into a broken down mansion, and then a mysterious woman is seen driving her car through the mud. On the back of the car is a heart, presumably that of the famous Tadanobu Asano, who died many years earlier.<br /><br />From there, the film introduces a seemingly random cast of characters, a number of whom are mysteriously killed, and of course, the story is given a make-shift bonfire scene. The scene of Miyazaki working on his latest film is followed by some montages of Japanese cars and people, and an ending shot featuring all of the participants in the bonfire dancing. At the very end of the film, the film comes to an abrupt and abrupt ending, with a pile of people laughing and clapping at the camera.<br /><br />Sure, you might have felt a bit cheated that Miyazaki chose to make a film as symbolic of the end of the world as The Wind Rises. But you also might have enjoyed the visual metaphor it served. All in all, The Wind Rises is an entertaining low budget film, which is part horror, part documentary, and probably more.

and this IS a very disturbing film. I may be wrong though but there is the strong possibility that it's an allegory of sorts.<br /><br />Directed by Argento he probably had to set out to make a movie that could be seen in a quiet setting in a very cramped theatre because there are a lot of controversial statements being made in this movie. Yes Argento does make some wonderful films but he was clearly influenced by Argento's earlier self and, in fact his personal fascism is in this film and the thing is, you could see in some of his films that he has a warped sense of reality but he never really dissolves into fascism like Argento did. The 'punching up of women' scene has to be one of the most disturbing in a cinema film ever.<br /><br />Why does the movie become so disturbing? Because the people making it are saying things that can only be described as over the top. They really can't be considered small time fascists or fascists in the most conventional sense but they are just plain big time nutters. In other words this is a film that goes for grating images over any truth it can dig up, it does have one reference to Freud that is disturbing and that can be found in the pool hall scene and that doesn't sit wel	1	0

If you know what I mean, you know it's not pretty.<br /><br />Directed by Dean Jagger, and starring Frank Sinatra, Mary Pickford, and others, you already know this is a lousy film. However, the writer and director also worked on The Natural. And while Sinatra did have his moments as the head of the casino, this one is really the story of a bullfighting ring.<br /><br />The film is about the Hall of Fame Bullfighters who actually won the Grand National championship in 1932. Now, they have been trying to compete at the NFL (now the N.F.L.). What eventually happens is that these wild stallion-type brawlers decide they want to go to the big leagues so that they can play in a league. The writer and director never shows that they actually want to go, so why would they even want to. However, the writers and directors did have a little fun with it, and even the cast has a few moments of hilarity and fun as they try to stop them.<br /><br />Another reason to see this film is if you haven't seen or even heard of the play by Glenn Miller called ""The Politician's Wife"""	1	0

The scintillating Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as an obnoxious hack haranguing a woman not so much for her looks as her stubbornness and tenacity. Elizabeth's major weakness in her film is not her physical beauty or her irreverent nature, it is her willingness to take a paycheck for anyone she tells, whether they're really interested in her or not. Ms. Taylor seems to think that making this woman's appearance credible is just a case of why she is in this picture. Surely that is the case?<br /><br />Towards the end of the film, a disgruntled fan strikes up a conversation with the lady in white about something she claims to have been an early fan of: Dorothy Parker's involvement with the Witchcraft Museum in New York, a supposedly pristine relic that is at the very least severely degraded, much like the hair-styling, cigarette smoking, ballroom dancing, etc. Not only is there absolutely no mention of the museum, but it is totally ignored.<br /><br />Although it is not entirely an entirely empty shot, the film never seems to get into the mystique of why Elizabeth Taylor is here.

She had her own personal doctor for a heart transplant, in the middle of the city, near the sidewalk of the new apartment building that had just been built. Her career would suffer when she came back to watch her son and daughter train, her job as a lab assistant, and she finds out she's not the only one. She's been calling it ""The Sickness"". She needs a heart, something that doesn't die in her heart. She tries everything she can think of. This is a big problem for Diane, she doesn't need one. Her doctor is looking to have her paralyzed.<br /><br />Karen finds a nice apartment. She and two of her employees are all nice and seem to like each other. The gang breaks up and Diane does what any intelligent person would do. She calls the new doctor, Her Ex-Girlfriend(Vivian Blaine). Her good friend and former wife comes in and tries to convince her that she's crazy. The doc tells her it's all lies, that Karen is not crazy, and they never saw anything of her from before.

One measurement for the greatness of a movie is, 'if it lasts 40 minutes, it's good.' 'Twelve Monkeys' seems like a movie that will last forever, and will be remembered for the strength of its characters and their interaction. What's more, the score by Max Steiner reminds me of something that I love about Stephen King's work: almost nothing is permanent.<br /><br />Two hours of 'Oh Brother' may not be really that long, but it feels like eternity. I only remember one or two very minor characters. I can remember that Roger Ebert said that the CGI was amazing. What is amazing to me is that none of this equipment was used. I can't believe that CGI has yet to replace the incredible assets that real people use, in places.<br /><br />I had already begun to figure out the central story when the first sentence was read to me. It started as a technicality: Jason Bourne had not yet been officially revealed. By the second sentence, the movie was completely clear. The mystery of the organization that was working on him was brought to life. By the third sentence, you had your answer. By the end of the movie, you had figured out the plot. In fact, the movie felt like any other movie. My first reaction wa	1	0
I've read countless of posts about this game being so violent...but there's one small problem I have with that. The main character seems to have the best training method of all of the soldiers. In game he takes his heavy machine gun to the little girl, and gives her a major hand crank and teaches her how to shoot through walls. Just the fact that they don't bother to correct this must have bothered them. The movie ends with her getting her gun and taking a big dump...let alone after a few hours of this. I want my money back, because I bought this game and was so disillusioned with it that I gave it away. After walking around here for 3 days, and I still don't understand why they cut such a cool character like him. If the other actors aren't bad, I could get to enjoy this. But after this...I'll be in line for a refund. 	1	0
I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it came out in 1943. The first was that I had just seen the Man From Laramie. The second reason was that for a guy who was very young at the time, there was something about the man that pulled me in. I suppose he wasn't very well known when he made this, but it still became my obsession when I got older. Now I just need to watch the Old World with my young eyes!<br /><br />I had one problem with the film. It was an import version. Though it has the European set costumes, all of it was West European. It looked somewhat cheaper than an American film, and to be honest, wasn't very exciting either. My wife thought it was pretty gory at times though. I would have to say it wasn't very authentic. It is worth a look though. 	0	1
"""Magic"" isn't too strong a word for the spell this movie succeeds in conjuring. The original version of this film was as different from today's standard as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"". It's no worse than other versions of ""The Wizard of Oz"" for example. It's a quirky little gem that doesn't require too much education on the film's scope to appreciate.<br /><br />Every attempt is made to blend the substance of the original with the wistfulness and humanity of the new world. For the most part, it works. The humor is lively and natural, and the heroine is inspired and emotionally engaged. The plot is nicely paced and involving. The sets, the characters, the acting...everything works well.<br /><br />The bottom line, however...even if the story is so good it demands a 60 minute version, the marketing of the movie would be pure genius. For years, people were so overly dazzled by its box office and subsequent financial success that they wasted no time in advertising it as a ""watchable"" effort. And the result is...the film is such a disappointment. <br /><br />It's nothing like the original that you'll enjoy. Instead, it just comes off as a very amateur version of something that had been done with increasing frequenc"	1	0

"Unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from Kerry Conran, for whom this is her debut feature (the fact that her previous two movies have been much better must surely be explained by that). Based on a novel by Arthur C. Clarke, this has all the hallmarks of a high-quality movie that would have been applauded by sci-fi fans back in the early 1990s. Although there are certainly recognizable stars on hand as well as others for whom these roles are minor. This story is about a little girl named Cassie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who comes to a small village in northern Africa that is slowly being ravaged by what looks like a brutal but inexorable tide of epidemic disease. For no good reason, the nation is halting its aid to her very tiny community (what is left of the ancient Nordic monarchy that she's been following on social media) and forced to send a newly-hired doctor, Dr. Mark Bullock (Peter Weller), back to that tiny community to do some research. Having already travelled to the same location to visit the local local tribe, he soon meets the local chief (Michael Jai White) who's asked him to investigate the mysterious origin of the mysterious ""scourge"" (aka ""widowmakers""). This has taken the life of local photographer Marvin Barris (Patrick Warburto"	0	1
Leslie Charteris' series of novels of the adventures of the flying spaghetti monster - Wai-Wai in particular - was a success at first, but with the release of the second film, X-men: First Class, it went downhill. Some of the other original films were well-regarded as classics and may be familiar to fans of the series, but after that disaster came First Class. While it does have some great moments (the credits may even mention the film) the majority of the films are abysmal and the third is by far the worst. Given the abundance of excellent future films, maybe it was better not to release the film in the first place but they may have had a point. As it stands, X-men: First Class - finally the lost and on DVD restoration version - is a complete let-down that I didn't even think to rate. 	1	0
"Richard Dreyfuss stars in ""Moon Over Parador,"" a 1988 Paul Thomas Anderson vehicle about a young man (Dreyfuss) who has recently fled the notorious Parador prison where he was transferred in 1978. Thaddeus Stone (Jeff Goldblum) is a man in prison who can't get parole for killing his wife, both were badly beaten and are still suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and depression. This sets up a personal relation between Dreyfuss and Stone. I have always admired John Glover for his heart. He is an amazing actor and you can't hate him because he's an incredible person.<br /><br />But the film is played straight with very little action to make the story work. There are many boring scenes which just drag on with little real drama, the ending seems staged and the low budget is an embarrassment for the folks behind the film, why was the budget made? <br /><br />If you are looking for a film which is dark, tense and good hearted then this is a film that you want to see.

I just did not enjoy this film. But then I really enjoyed Spacecamp. The full impact of the film is not as great as Spacecamp and I am not comparing it to Spacecamp because I do not think it is as good as Spacecamp. The only great thing about this film is Jamie Lee Curtis and John Travolta. Not to mention...who could forget Pamela Reed's catchphrase? See Spacecamp. It has a similar idea to this film. 	0	1
"A young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on how Neanderthals were able to travel long distances on foot. He's proved himself a genius. But as far as the Neanderthals are concerned, he's their weak link in the chain. He and his wife believe that ""possession"" over half of a Neanderthal's body would be enough to effectively subject them to genetic manipulation. With the professor's help, they steal a shiny new American flag and run. In their haste, however, they run into the same professor, Oleg, a very charming and charismatic figure with a slightly steely touch. After getting back his body and two surprises from away, Oleg becomes a new part of the Neanderthal society and begins teaching them how to hunt and kill their way to perfection.<br /><br />The story starts well, with some particularly funny and chilling moments, including the interplay between the professor and Oleg. (Even better, it takes us back to some of the oldest bones discovered in the last century: those of a 14-to-16-year-old male human who has been embalmed and preserved by Neanderthals and his skeleton has a wide variety of facial features and scars that were consistent with the skeleton of a possibly unrelated adult male in the South Seas.

"A small funny film. It is totally incredible, unbelievable, impossible. You wonder how people can get their hands on this film. It is that impressive that the movie was made a decade before the famous ""Freaks"" got their big break. This film is known for it's short length and by that, almost always lasting 15 minutes, one second long. On a serious note, it may scare some children. Be warned: one may get scared during the opening scene. <br /><br />Rating: *****<br /><br />A few words about the special effects. Nothing special. The computer in one of the rooms does not look like an Intellivision at all. It is a sub- computer with gears and wires that leads to what looks like the big computer. I felt sorry for the long-haired character, given what a strange movie he is, because of the awful sight. <br /><br />What does the movie contain? Some cute little creatures, such as a fox and fox and cat, or a wolf and a dog. A house and a little boy. Some skin and very little else. The cat seems to come from another planet, only this is not explained. <br /><br />Oh, and there is a creature called ""Moonlight"", but no one knows wher"	1	0
"White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First nations = DEAD. Human nature = NOTHING. These are and will always be myths, unless you get from them the food for your soul. Facing one's individual difficulties is part of human nature, the way we remember it. ""Technology"" isn't going to solve these problems. White man has created problems that prevent Africans from gaining our confidence. Also, I don't believe in saving the world by giving all the world's riches to Africans. I don't believe in taking the money that has been given to me by others and making it go toward others. That would be ridiculous. What is amazing about this movie is that it is a good thing to view.<br /><br />These things must end, no matter who controls them. If I were the US government I'd be sending 100,000,000,000 messages to the UN (or its equivalent) asking them to destroy nations that don't follow what the American way of thinking is telling them to. If I were the US government I would do it by doing all of the things that I did to Africa. That way we'd have our own country which would be much better off than what we've been doing since the last several years. That way we wouldn't have to worry about finding foo"	1	0
Yes, I did, as I sit here red-faced, remembering having heard nothing about this film for about 4 years. But I made a list of films to see. The list kept growing. My list included L'Oréal (which I wanted to see and was in the middle of this one) Alien (written by Steve Biko), Basic Instinct, Law & Order, Tomb Raider, Better Call Saul, Training Day, The Avengers and the ridiculous John Candy vehicle The Virgin, to name just a few. I would have sat on the list for months and years, watching all those films and then seeing them ALL at once in one night. I thought to myself...what has John Candy done?<br /><br />Well, about three years ago, after hearing so much about the film (thanks to the fact that I have nothing else to do), I decided to watch it, knowing only a little about it. For about 6 hours, I waited for this movie to happen, hoping that it would at least be good, but with such an obvious crummy story, I was even more disappointed.<br /><br />Well, this movie isn't so bad. The acting is in the mid-range and the storyline is even worse. The plot is that after wife Sharon commits suicide, she sends a letter t	1	0
"Bear in mind, any film (let alone documentary) which asserts that Manson family members were sex slaves and cultists is way over the top and downright false. This isn't true. The Manson family were well-known police informers and never served in the military. (The actual sadistic sex-abuse photo album released by the Manson Family shows all members of the family except for Bobby brutally stabbed and mutilated by fellow informer Michael Woods.) (Since it's such a red herring, Manson himself asserts that the family were themselves ""outsiders"" from the law, holding their own lawless behavior out to discredit and discredit even further.) In any event, those qualities show only that the Family was a well-established law unto itself and did little to hide their hostility toward the rest of the population.<br /><br />The rest of the family were equally untouchable by the law and much of the criminal history is heavily distorted (even the infamous videotaped execution of the Todd and Janet Moore family). This documentary does a disservice to its subject and to those of us who just want to know what really happened to the family during the Manson trials (although an overwhelming majority of Americans still can't believe that such an incredible atrocity ever happened).<br /><br />Other reviewers have compared this documentary to film n"	1	0
"Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. ""The Missionary"" is a slow-burning American film that would have been much better directed and acted by an Indian actor. The plot is weak, the acting is horrible, and the highlight of the film is a story about how the film-maker never watched his previous work and failed to learn from it. At times, you truly believe that he just gave up on the job after watching the standard American film of the same year, ""Paper Moon"". The only thing that saved the film is the acting of the two leads, Rutger Hauer and Hrishikesh Hirway. There is really no explanation why these two actors do what they do, as they should never have taken part in such a disaster in American film history!<br /><br />7/10 "	1	0
"Well, I just discovered that there is a show more outrageously boring than The Shield, and that is 24. It's The Shield - a slightly better show that everybody around the camp seems to love, but it's also very boring. The plot is about a group of activists who go to Guantanamo Bay for years and are captured by the military and are released so they can focus their activism on fighting against the evil war in Iraq. Although the script is good, the writing, production and directing are horrendous. I only watch The Shield when I need to watch a show or some disgusting cheap porn. And the nudity is terrible. What is even worse is that most people seem to think that all the people in the military are uniformly stupid and possess evil behavior. That's completely wrong. I have known lots of officers, from 2nd class generals all the way up to black-ops sergeants. (Yes, I know it's different than a senior enlisted position, but that's a huge difference in acting ability anyway). I have never met one single one of these ""men of action"" with any knowledge of war, military history or even basic weaponry (take the train for example). That in itself is not really interesting. Instead, I watch for the occasional great line or dramatic scene - at least that was the case wit"	1	0
"Oh-so-familiar comedy story about low-key nice-guy Paul (Jason Lee), who gets bitten by a bug and has to live with an extremely harsh and highly disruptive therapist, Tabitha (Lisa Kudrow). Paul's being treated by Dr. Philip Danforth, but not by a woman. Which is no great revelation: Women being treated in real medical facilities are generally not allowed to watch or listen in on private conversations or being subjected to any form of invasive body probing. But Tabitha, a beauty therapist, learns that the fact that Paul is not a threat to her and that she's enjoying him has him indeed ""disabled."" Of course, if her job requires her to aggressively interrogate men in order to get the good parts out of them, then everyone has their contract torn up. Not a very pleasant lesson.<br /><br />The funny thing is that Lee is very much at his ""small"" best here. It's clear that he has a gift for playing brash, dramatic, unusual characters, so it would be a great shame if this film were to die. But with Kudrow and Lee as ""twists"" that would be far less pleasant. There's a winning combination of Lee's smart writing and Kudrow's charming exuberance. I love Lee's characterization of his character as a sensitive u"	0	1
"I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. It moved so beautifully and went for so many different moods. The box said that it would be just for kids, which I think was a mistake. I found it too adult. It could have been more for a 7 year old. The lead actress was cute and she was allowed to come off as a damsel in distress for kids. There were many parts where I said, ""Wow, what a completely unnecessary part of the movie...those children shouldn't be in it."" I am the kind of parent that will agree to send my kids to an R rated movie if they ask for it, but I cannot tolerate kids getting involved in something that I do not think will enrich their lives. Don't waste your money on this movie! "	0	1

A very good story for a film which if done well might make it to the next level. The movie is very well done with wonderful sound effects. The cast does a good job. There's a lot of violence in it and if it wasn't for a few scenes at the end, some people might find it a bit disturbing. This film is very creative and there are scenes which make you cry. To make a long story short, this is a good film to have a drink or just relax on. 	0	1
Well, let me start off by saying how utterly HILARIOUS this movie was. The King of All Crusades was in my opinion, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. JB does the perfect job in bringing his character to life, the story was drawn out and the endings were devastatingly brilliant, let alone for the younger children to watch (oh wait till they're old enough to remember them..). There were more laughs than there were tears, a great mix of acting talents and a great heart in the final result. If you are a Ken Loach fan, you should go rent this movie and watch it just to see what all he has done in the past. 	0	1
There is a uk edition to this show which is actually BETTER than the unrated version. The film is very good, but far from original. The music from the unrated version is great, but it just doesn't fit with the movie. The one part that works is the part where Timmy thinks he is supposed to fight with Madge. That part is EXACTLY what it should be in the show. That alone is worth the whole film. The re-cutting wasn't THAT bad, as I actually like the new cut of the show, so I guess it was just for the BETTER TV version.<br /><br />Unfortunately this wasn't even on DVD, and I can't really complain about that. There was only one chapter that I saw, the episode where Uncle Jesse and his sidekick are beating down a jailhouse and him and Lisa are in there and he uses his power to destroy the floor and the doors before they can shut it down! That was the ONLY time this went on, and I didn't see the others! 	0	1
"This is a good example a film that in spite of itself doesn't make for a great movie. It's not a great movie because the structure and story are lacking. The weak point is the fact that it doesn't really follow up the original from the first or even follow up the first premise on its own. I mean they didn't really have to give us that anyway.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, if it were up to me, I'd imagine that Timothy Hines and Michael Radford would be on this film. Hines is perfectly cast as the rich, pompous husband who turns out to be that lot who murders people as they're leaving a party. He's got charm and charm doesn't take away from his intentions. Michael Radford isn't entirely bad, he's just not likable. But again, that's just me. What was the problem with the film? <br /><br />In any event, this is an excellent example of the plight of the ""strong"" movie. The rest of the film is just a mess. No wonder it was made. This is one of those films that those who can make their way in Hollywood will always find an outlet for their talents. "	1	0
"""The Grudge"" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of horror classics ""Anatomy of a Murder"" and ""The Grudge"". Which in case you're wondering don't you think the horror icon's shows this film as his big budget instalment? I would give this film a 6 since it features most of the excellent actors from ""Anatomy of a Murder"". Honestly ""The Grudge"" didn't have the greatest casting. Robert Englund was in the (and still underrated) underrated ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" and Ewa Michalak did a bang up job in the ""Barnyard Book"". Oh and did I mention that Anna Paquin did a great job?<br /><br />So without further ado... and just one word: DO. Not. Skip this film!<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />What an outrage... the scene where William Pitt appears to become obsessed with looking into the camera, until he actually jumps out at it, in that moment when he's about to do that which has the power to destroy the world, is so surreal.
